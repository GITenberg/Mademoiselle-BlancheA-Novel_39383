<h2>Mademoiselle Blanche</h2>

<h2>I</h2>

<p class="indent">&quot;André!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little waiter, with anxiety in his
smooth, blond face, hurried to the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bring me the <i>Soir</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">André shot away, and presently returned,
paper in hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is there good at the theatres,
André?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">André wiped his hands in his soiled apron,
and looked thoughtful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's the <i>Folies Bergères</i>, monsieur.
Dumont sings to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she tires me. Her voice is cracked.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's Madame Judic at the <i>Variétés</i>,&quot;
André suggested, tentatively.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
&quot;I saw her in the last piece.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">André scratched his head, and stared at
the figure at the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur likes the <i>Cirque</i>, does he
not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Monsieur did not look up from the paper.
&quot;What's at the <i>Cirque</i> now, André?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At the <i>Cirque Parisien</i>? There's Mademoiselle
Blanche, the acrobat. They say she's
a marvel, monsieur,&mdash;and beautiful,&mdash;the
most beautiful woman in Paris. She dives
from the top of the building backwards&mdash;hundreds
of feet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you think it's really good, André?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">André nodded. Monsieur dropped the
paper, paid his bill, left a little fee for the
<i>garçon</i>, and took himself off. At the entrance
he stopped and surveyed the surging
crowd in the <i>Boulevard Montmartre</i>. He
had just finished an excellent dinner with
a glass of <i>chartreuse verte</i>; so he felt particularly
complacent. As he prodded his teeth
with the easy grace of the Frenchman who
knows no shame of the toothpick, he tried
to think out a plan for the evening. Nothing
better occurred to him than André's suggestion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
He was not in the mood for the
<i>Casino de Paris</i>, nor for any of the other
concert halls, nor even for the theatres.
Yes, he would go to the Circus. He hadn't
been there for ten days.</p>

<p class="indent">For years Jules Le Baron had attended
the <i>Cirque Parisien</i> at least once a fortnight;
his friends used to chaff him for his
fondness for it. Those who had known him
from a boy liked to remind him of his first
great ambition&mdash;to be a performer on the
trapeze. Though this amused him now, he
had never lost his love for feats of daring
and skill. Whenever he felt particularly
tired from his work at the wool-house, he
would go to the Circus; it refreshed him,
and he fancied that it made him sleep
well afterwards. His first love had been
a beautiful Roumanian, who jumped through
hoops of fire, landing on her velvet-caparisoned
horse, without even singeing her
long, blond hair. He was fifteen then, and
he discovered that the lady was forty-five,
though he could have sworn there was
not a difference of more than three years
in their ages. Since that time he had become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
enamoured of many of the glittering
amazons of the arena, who shot through
the air, or through hoops, or out of the
mouths of cannons, or crossed dizzy heights
on the tight-rope, or juggled with long,
villainous-looking knives falling in showers
into their hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Those episodes, however, brightened Jules
Le Baron's life long before he was twenty-five.
He had since had many similar experiences
in the larger arena of the world.
Indeed, he gloried in his susceptibility;
he used to give people to understand that,
though fairly successful in business, he had
a very keen appreciation of the sentiments,
and of all the refinements of life. To a
foreigner he would have expressed this complication
by saying that he was Parisian to
his finger-tips. In America, where, at the
age of twenty-six, he passed three wretched
months, he had been appalled by the lack
of sentiment among the people. Of course,
as he represented there the wool-house with
which he had been connected since his
sixteenth year, he met chiefly business men;
but even these ought to have displayed an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
interest in something outside their commercial
routine.</p>

<p class="indent">It was those three months in America
that gave Jules Le Baron his zest for Paris.
Of course, he had always loved it; but
till he left it, his love had not become
self-conscious. America taught him what
he had only dimly known before, that for
him Paris was the only city in the world
worth living in. He knew that people born
away from Paris liked other cities; secretly,
however, this amused him. He believed
that no one, after living in Paris, could find
any other place habitable. Indeed, any
places, any people, any customs foreign to
Paris seemed to him so droll that at the
thought of some of them he often laughed
aloud. America had given him things to
laugh at for the rest of his life.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, Jules was proud of having
visited America; it gave him a delightful
feeling of superiority to his friends and
acquaintances at home. He always felt
pleased when the English and Americans
that he met in business complimented him
on his English; it enabled him to say carelessly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
&quot;Oh, I just picked it up when I was
in America.&quot; He really had learned very
little English there; nearly all he knew had
been taught him by his father, a professor
of chemistry in a small school in Paris,
who had spent six months in England
during the siege. He had acquired there,
however, a smattering of American slang;
on his lips it sounded delicious. His friends
in Paris thought he spoke English beautifully,
and frequently referred to his talent
for languages. He had given them glowing
accounts of his adventures in America,
and said nothing of his desolate loneliness
there; so they looked upon him as a born
traveller,&mdash;as, altogether, a man of remarkable
qualities. But for his English and his travels,
they would merely have shrugged their shoulders
at the mention of his name, and dismissed
him with a &quot;<i>Bon garçon!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules Le Baron knew that he was much
more than a <i>bon garçon</i>. His attitude
toward the world expressed this; he always
acted as if he felt the world had been made
exclusively for him. After losing his father
at fourteen, he promptly proceeded to link
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
his mother in the closest bonds of slavery.
Yet he was kind to her, too, and, in his
way, he loved her, for she was made to
obey, just as he had been born to command.
When she died and left him alone at the
age of twenty with a small property, he
took a miniature apartment in the <i>rue de
Lisbonne</i>, and adjusted himself to his new
life. His salary at the wool-house, where
his English helped to make him valuable,
together with the property, gave him an
income of ten thousand francs a year. He
considered himself rich, a personage, one
who ought to marry well.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules had thought so much about marriage
that, at thirty, it was surprising he should
have remained unwedded. Every young
woman he met he regarded as a candidate
for his hand, and he spent a large part of
his leisure in rejecting these innocent suitors.
Even now, as he slowly made his way up
the <i>Boulevard</i>, he fancied that the girls he
passed were looking at him admiringly and
enviously. He often smiled back at them,
for he was rarely unkind and he never gratuitously
wounded any one's feelings. With
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
his mother, it is true, he had been occasionally
severe, but merely to discipline her,
to make her see things as he saw them.
At this moment he felt particularly amiable.
He was in Paris, on the <i>Boulevard</i> that he
loved, surrounded by the people that he
loved, in the atmosphere which, as he had
discovered in America, was as the very
breath to his being. The spectacle was
all for him! Paris, had been created that
he might enjoy it!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span></p>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="indent">Saturday was the fashionable night at
the <i>Cirque Parisien</i>, and the night
when Jules usually attended it. This was
Tuesday, however, and Jules decided not to
be fashionable, but simply to amuse himself.
As he approached the letters of light that
flashed the name of the <i>Cirque</i> into the eyes
of the <i>boulevardiers</i>, he suddenly remembered
that he had promised to meet two of
his comrades of the wool-house in the evening.
He turned into the <i>rue Taitbout</i>, and as he
was walking slowly through the long passageway
leading into one of the large apartment-houses
there, he felt himself suddenly seized
in the darkness by two pairs of hands. He
looked quickly around, and dimly recognized
Dufresne and Leroux, who had come up from
behind him. They were both types, short
and swarthy, with oily faces, thick black
moustaches, and pointed beards.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
&quot;Why didn't you come before?&quot; and &quot;We've
been waiting an hour,&quot; they cried together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's been up to some adventure, I'll
wager,&quot; said Leroux.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Answer! The truth! No lies!&quot; Dufresne
exclaimed, shaking him by one shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules pulled away with an effort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you were going to rob me!&quot;
he laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, he doesn't answer,&quot; said Dufresne.
&quot;I told you he was up to some
adventure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Up to some adventure!&quot; Jules repeated.
&quot;I've just been taking dinner, and I forgot
I'd promised to meet you to-night. Where
are you going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We're going to the <i>Folies Bergères</i>, and
then to a masked ball in Montmartre,&quot;
Leroux answered, resuming his grip. &quot;Come
along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules pulled away with a laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks. Not to-night. I don't feel like
it. Besides, I'm not dressed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But <i>we're</i> not dressed,&quot; they cried together,
throwing open their coats. &quot;You
won't have to dress. Come on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
Jules shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; he insisted, &quot;it's all very well for
you young bucks. I'm too old. It tires
me out for the next day; can't do my work.
I think I'll look in at the Circus. Come
along with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They scoffed at the idea of going to the
Circus, and tried to persuade him to accompany
them, since he had kept them waiting
so long. But he resisted, and, as he turned
away from them, they clutched at him again,
but he escaped, laughing, into the street, and
he saw them shaking their fists after him.
Those two &quot;boys,&quot; as he called them, were
always trying to drag him into their escapades.
They looked so much alike that at
the office they were called &quot;the twins,&quot; and
they were always getting into scrapes and
into debt together.</p>

<p class="indent">Before buying his ticket for the Circus,
Jules looked carefully over the program on
the posters in the long entrance. Some of
the performers he had already seen and the
names of a few of them were unfamiliar to him.
One name was printed in larger letters than
the others&mdash;Mademoiselle Blanche. Jules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
read the paragraph printed below, announcing
Mademoiselle Blanche as the most marvellous
acrobat in the world, and proclaiming
that, in addition to giving her act on the
trapeze, she would plunge backward from
the top of the theatre, a height of more than
seventy-five feet, into a net below. Jules
smiled, and felt a thrill of his old boyish
excitement at the prospect of seeing the
feat performed.</p>

<p class="indent">When he turned to buy his ticket, he
noticed a large photograph on an easel,
standing near the box-office. The name of
Mademoiselle Blanche, printed under it, attracted
him. The acrobat, her long sinuous
limbs encased in white tights, was suspended
in mid-air, one arm bent at the elbow, clinging
to a trapeze. The tense muscles of the
arm made a curious contrast with the expression
of the face, which was marked by
unusual simplicity and gentleness. The profile
was clear, the curving eyelashes were
delicately outlined, and the eyes were large
and dark. Something about the lines of the
small mouth attracted Jules. He studied
the picture carefully to discover what it was.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
The whole expression of the face seemed to
him to be concentrated in the mouth; he felt
sure that the teeth were small and very white,
and the woman's voice was soft and musical.
The face differed from the ordinary types of
performers he had seen; it reminded him
of the faces of some of the girls in the convent
of Beauvais, where his mother had once
taken him to visit his cousin. The woman
must be clever to make herself up so attractively.
He wondered if the appearance of
youth that she presented was also due to her
cleverness. She might easily pass for twenty.
Her figure looked marvellously supple; she
had probably been trained for the circus from
infancy, and she might be fifty years old.</p>

<p class="indent">He decided not to buy a seat, but to go
into the balcony where he could walk about
and look down at the performance. If it
bored him, he could rest on one of the velvet-cushioned
seats till a new &quot;turn&quot; began.
He found more people in the balcony than
he had ever seen there before; as a rule
they made only a thin fringe around the
railing; now they were five and six deep.
He established himself beside a post where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
he could catch glimpses of the arena and
get a support, and there he remained for
half an hour.</p>

<p class="indent">To-night, however, the antics of the clown,
the phenomenal intelligence of the performing
dogs, even the agility of the Schaeffer
family of acrobats, did not interest him. He
was impatient to see Mademoiselle Blanche.
Her name stood last on the program; she
was probably reserved for a crowning attraction.
Jules dropped on one of the velvet
cushions, and rested there for another half-hour.
Then some knife-throwing attracted
him, and he slowly worked his way through
the crowd to a place where he could look
down at the performers. The knife-throwing
was followed by an exhibition of trick-riding,
which preceded the acrobat's appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">Before this appearance took place, however,
there was a long wait caused by the
preparations made for the great plunge. A
thick rope was suspended from one of the
beams that supported the roof of the building,
and under it a net was spread. Then the
half-dozen trapezes that had been tied to
the walls, were loosened, and as they swung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
in the air and the band played, Mademoiselle
Blanche, in white silk tights, with two long
strips of white satin ribbon dangling from
her throat, ran into the ring, and bowed in
response to the applause of the crowd.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules Le Baron drew a long breath. The
long supple limbs, the firm white arms and
throat, the pale oval face, framed in dark
hair that curled around the forehead, created
a kind of beauty that seemed almost ethereal.
The glamour of youth was over her, too; she
could not be, at most, more than twenty.
As she ran up the little rope ladder to the net
and climbed hand over hand along the rope
to one of the trapezes, Jules thought he had
never seen such grace, such exquisite sureness
of movement and agility. After reaching
the trapeze, she sat there for a moment,
smiling and rubbing her hands. Then she
began to swing gently, and a moment later
she shot through the air to another trapeze
several feet away, and from that she passed
on to the others with a bewildering swiftness.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules had never seen a woman perform
alone on the trapeze before, and this exhibition
of skill and resource fascinated him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
The feats were nearly all new, and some of
them of unusual difficulty. When the girl
had finished her performance on the trapeze
she returned to the rope, and began to pose
on it, twisting it around her waist, and hanging
suspended with her arms in the air. In
this way she rolled gently down to the net.</p>

<p class="indent">The event of the evening was yet to come,
however. After resting for a moment, Mademoiselle
Blanche seized the rope again,
and, hand over hand, she climbed to the top
of the building; there she sat on a beam, so
far from the audience that she seemed much
smaller than she really was. The ring-master,
a greasy-looking Frenchman in evening
dress, appeared in the arena and commanded
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mademoiselle Blanche must have perfect
quiet,&quot; he cried, &quot;in order to perform her
great feat. The least noise might disturb
her, and cause her death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules smiled at this speech; it was very
clever, he thought. Of course, it was made
merely to impress the audience. He wondered
how Mademoiselle Blanche felt at that
moment, perched up there so quietly, ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
to hurl herself into the air. He did not
have time to think much about this, for as
he strained his eyes toward her, the signal
for the fall was given, the white figure
plunged backward, spun to earth, landed
with a tremendous thump in the padded net,
bounded into the air again, and Mademoiselle
Blanche was bowing and kissing her fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment not a sound was heard.
Then the audience burst into applause, and
Jules Le Baron breathed. He felt as if his
heart had stopped beating. He had never
seen such a thrilling exhibition before.
All his old delight in the circus had come
back to him. As he walked out with the
crowd, he congratulated himself on not having
gone with Dufresne and Leroux. He
would not have missed his evening for a
dozen balls in Montmartre!</p>

<p class="indent">At the door he met Roger Durand, dramatic
critic of the <i>Jour</i>. He had known
Durand as a boy, and they had continued
on a footing of half-hostile friendship.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you've come to see the new sensation?&quot;
said the journalist, as they shook
hands.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
&quot;Just by chance,&quot; Jules replied. &quot;I've
never been more surprised in my life. Who
is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's just what I haven't been able to
find out. I've been talking about her tonight
with old Réju&mdash;he's the man who
makes the engagements&mdash;but he didn't
seem to know much more about her than I
did. He said he first heard of her in Bucharest.
She made a hit there, too, some time
last year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she's French, isn't she? Parisian?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's French, but Réju says she isn't
Parisian&mdash;comes from the provinces somewhere.
There's a woman goes about with
her, her mother, I suppose. Réju says
mamma keeps her down here,&quot; the journalist
added with a smile, making a significant
gesture with his thumb. &quot;Mamma gets all
the money, and Mademoiselle does all the
work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Going to
your office?&quot; he said. &quot;You have to turn
night into day, haven't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear fellow, night is the best part of
life. Days were made for sleep. We've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
got mixed up, that's all, and only a few of
us are clever enough to find it out. Come
and have a glass of absinthe with me before
I go back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some other time. A glass of absinthe
would spoil me for to-morrow. <i>Au revoir.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was glad to be alone again so that he
might think over the evening. The beautiful
figure whirling through the air still haunted
him. &quot;Mademoiselle Blanche!&quot; The name
seemed to sing in his mind. He wondered
what her real name was. So she had a
mother who kept her under her thumb!
Then he wondered what she was like out of
the circus&mdash;ignorant and vulgar, probably,
like the rest of them. Yet in her looks she
was certainly different from the rest. At any
rate, he must go and see her performance
again. He would go several times.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span></p>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="indent">When Jules arrived home he found
supper on the table of his little
dining-room. Madeleine, the old woman
who had served his mother for years and remained
with him after his mother's death, always
left something for him at night. Now
he turned away from it in disgust. His face
was burning; he felt nervous, excited. After
going to bed, he was unable to sleep. He
kept seeing Mademoiselle Blanche tumbling
through the air! He could not think of
her except as in motion. He tried to recall
her as she stood in the net, just before
climbing the rope to the trapeze, but her
figure was vague and shadowy. Then he
tried to think out her features as he had
observed them, and he found that he had quite
forgotten her face; all that remained was an
impression of sweetness, of a ravishing smile.</p>

<p class="indent">When, finally, he fell asleep, he dreamed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
of her, still flashing through the air, striking
with a thud the padded net, and bouncing
to her feet again. He woke several times
and felt impatient with himself for not being
able to drive the thought away; yet when
he sank again into sleep, the dream came
back persistently.</p>

<p class="indent">At half-past seven he rose, tired from his
broken rest. He went at once to the long
mirror that covered the door of his wardrobe,
expecting to be confronted with the
face of an invalid. His gray eyes were
slightly inflamed and his cheeks had more
than their usual color; otherwise his appearance
was normal. For several moments he
surveyed himself. As a rule he did not
think much about his looks; he knew that
he was considered handsome, and this gave
him a half-unconscious gratification. When
he wanted to please a woman he seldom
failed. Now he had a distinct pleasure at
the sight of the aristocratic curve of his nose,
the strong outline of his chin, the full red
lips under his thick brown moustache. Jules
wished that he could keep from growing fat;
but after all, he reflected philosophically,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
there was a difference in fatness; some men
it made gross and vulgar; his own complexion,
however, was so fair that he could
never look gross. Even now there was a
suggestion about him of the sleekness of a
well-kept pigeon.</p>

<p class="indent">When he went out to breakfast he found
Madeleine looking doleful. Madeleine had
known Jules from birth and considered herself
a second mother to him. She was short
and stout, with a mouthful of very bad teeth,
some of which rattled when she spoke, as if
they were about to fall out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur Jules did not eat last night,&quot;
she said as she poured his coffee and pushed
his rolls into the centre of the little table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Madeleine, I wasn't hungry.&quot; Jules
took up the <i>Figaro</i> that was lying on the
table and began to look for a reference to
Mademoiselle Blanche.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The coffee will grow cold, Monsieur Jules.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules did not hear her. When preoccupied,
he had a habit of ignoring Madeleine.
Yet, in his way, he liked her; he
often wondered what he would do without
her; she was docile and attentive to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
wants as his mother had been, and she was
very inexpensive. For five minutes he read;
then, when he found no reference to the
acrobat, he threw down the paper with an
exclamation of impatience, and seized his
cup and sipped his coffee.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's cold!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine's look of distress deepened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me take that away,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll
get another cup.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When she brought the cup and poured
some of the hot coffee into it, Jules drained it,
and pushed his chair away from the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you have eaten nothing, Monsieur
Jules!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm not hungry this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you didn't eat anything last night,&quot;
the old woman repeated, following him with
her eyes. &quot;Are you sick?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no!&quot; Jules replied, impatiently. &quot;I
don't feel like eating, that's all. Give me
my hat and coat, Madeleine; I shall be late
if I don't hurry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur Jules doesn't look well,&quot; said
Madeleine timidly, as she helped him on
with his coat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
&quot;Oh, don't worry about me.&quot; At the
door Jules turned. &quot;I shall be out late
again to-night, Madeleine. You needn't
leave the light burning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The wool-house of Ballou, Mercier &amp; Co.,
where Jules worked, was only ten minutes'
walk from the <i>rue de Lisbonne</i>. On his
way there, Jules resolved to say nothing to
the twins about Mademoiselle Blanche. Of
course, Leroux would ask him about the
evening, and he would say simply that he
had been rather bored. He wanted to keep
Mademoiselle Blanche to himself. He even
hoped that her performance would not be
noised abroad, that she would not become
one of those women whom all Paris went
to see and every one talked glibly about. But
she must be well-known already; it was evidently
her performance that had crowded
the Circus.</p>

<p class="indent">At the office the twins had a great deal
to say about the masked ball of the previous
night, but Jules hardly heard them. He
was still so haunted by the thought of Mademoiselle
Blanche that he made several mistakes
in his letters; since his return from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
America he had been placed in charge of
all the English correspondence, and it was
important that he should be exact. The
day had never seemed so long to him, nor
his work, in which he usually took pride,
so dull. He was impatient for the evening.
When six o'clock came, he hurried away
without bidding the twins good-night.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules walked toward the little restaurant
in the <i>Boulevard</i> where he had dined the
night before. He wanted to see André
again, to talk over Mademoiselle Blanche
with him. He felt almost a personal affection
for André now. The little <i>garçon</i> was
bewildered by Jules' affability, and overcome
by the generous tip which he received as
Jules left the place. Indeed, freed from
the labors of the day, Jules felt buoyant
and happy. But when he reached the
Circus, his spirits sank; he had forgotten
that Mademoiselle Blanche did not appear
till nearly eleven. He would have to wait
for her at least three hours!</p>

<p class="indent">He felt so vexed that he turned away from
the theatre and walked along the <i>Boulevard</i>.
It was late in October, and a light rain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
was falling, mixed with snow. The <i>Boulevard</i>
was crowded with people, hurrying
under umbrellas. Jules turned up the collar
of his overcoat, and shivered. What was
he to do till eleven? He might go to one
of the theatres, but he would not enjoy it.
When he reached the <i>Opéra</i>, he had not
made up his mind what to do, and he
walked on as far as the Madeleine. He
entered a <i>café</i> opposite the church, and
called for a bock and one of the illustrated
papers. For an hour he sat there, sipping
the beer and pretending to read. The jokes,
however, which he usually enjoyed, seemed
to him vulgar. He was thinking of the
figure in white silk tights, shooting through
the air. A score of times he called himself a
fool for not being able to put that thought
out of his mind; yet he felt nervous and
irritable, simply because he was impatient
to see the spectacle again. At last he became
so uneasy that he looked for the
waiter to pay his bill and leave. Then he
felt a slap on the shoulder, and Durand's
smiling face confronted him.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no reason why Jules should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
have been displeased at seeing Durand;
yet at that moment he felt resentful. The
journalist was small and dapper, with the
ends of his black moustache carefully waxed.
His little black eyes were always sparkling
with humor, and when he smiled he showed
two rows of regular white teeth. Yet, in
spite of the care of himself which he seemed
to take, he never looked quite clean; his
thick black hair was always dusty with dandruff,
which fell on the shoulders of his coat.
He spoke in a high thin voice and with
a patronizing air that exasperated Jules.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought I recognized your back,&quot; he
said, when Jules had turned his face toward
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules grunted and pointed to a chair at
the little table. He wanted to show by
his manner that he didn't like that familiar
slap. Durand, however, was unruffled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing here, anyway?
Why aren't you at the theatre or one of
the <i>cafés chantants</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules took a puff of his cigarette, and then
looked down at the little figure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might ask you the same question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
&quot;Oh, I'm working. This is a busy night
for me.&quot; Then Durand's face lighted.
&quot;What do you suppose I've got to do
to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules knocked the ashes of his cigarette
against the edge of the table. &quot;Now, do
you mean? I can't imagine. You're always
doing impossible things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going to interview the little acrobat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules came very near jumping. He controlled
himself, however, and carelessly lifted
the cigarette to his lips again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What little acrobat?&quot; he asked, screwing
his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The one you saw last night&mdash;at the
<i>Cirque</i>&mdash;the <i>Cirque Parisien</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mademoiselle&mdash;Mademoiselle&mdash;what's
her name&mdash;the one who dives from
the top of the building?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Mademoiselle Blanche. When I
went back to the office last night, I told
old Bargy about her&mdash;cracked her up to
the skies, and he swallowed the bait, and
sent me round to interview her to-night.
Ah, my dear boy, that's one of the advantages
of being a newspaper man. It opens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
every door to you. Whenever I want to
get acquainted with a pretty actress, I simply
go and interview her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sat back in his seat and smiled and
hummed a popular song, rapping the table
with his fingers. The waiter came up and
asked for his order.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two bocks!&quot; said Durand, looking at
Jules.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no more for me. I haven't finished
this yet.&quot; When the waiter went
away, Jules glanced sleepily at the journalist.
&quot;You're a very lucky fellow, it seems to
me. I should think it would be rather
agreeable to know the pretty actresses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Durand shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Sometimes,
yes&mdash;sometimes, no. Usually it spoils
the illusion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules stared thoughtfully at his bock.
&quot;Aren't you afraid you'll be disillusioned
by Mademoiselle Blanche?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, probably. They're all alike&mdash;when
you come to know them. But there's something
about her that made me think she
might be a little different from the rest. At
any rate, she's dev'lish pretty, isn't she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
&quot;Do you think so?&quot; Jules asked, with a
deprecating lift of the eyebrows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think so! I know so! If you don't
think so you must be hard to please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I thought she was pretty in her
circus rig. I should like to see her out of
the ring. They make up so, those women.
You can't tell whether they're really pretty
or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, come around with me, and I'll
introduce you. Then you can see for yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules nearly jumped again, but his cigarette
helped him to disguise the impulse. &quot;I'm
afraid I shall be in the way,&quot; he said, after a
meditative puff.</p>

<p class="indent">Durand had seized the bock left on the
table by the waiter, and was holding it over
his head. When half the contents had disappeared,
he smacked his lips and wiped them
with his handkerchief. &quot;Not at all. You'll
help me draw her out. They say she does
the shy-young-girl act; so she's hard to talk
with. That seems to be a favorite pose of
actresses nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules' heart was throbbing. He was afraid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
that Durand would discover his elation. So
he tried to appear indifferent and cynical.
Durand's cynicism amused him; yet in the
journalist's presence he was always trying to
imitate it.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had drained his bock, Durand
stood up, surveyed with a professional eye
the crowd at the tables, nodded to a few acquaintances,
and made a sign to Jules that he
was ready to go. It had ceased raining, but
the sky was still leaden. The splendid portico
of the Madeleine loomed out of the darkness,
and the lights in the <i>Boulevard des Capucines</i>
were gleaming faintly in the mist. They met
few people as they walked toward the <i>Opéra</i>,
but there was plenty of life around the theatres
in the <i>Boulevard des Italiens</i>. When
they reached the <i>Cirque</i>, Durand had a
whispered consultation with the <i>Control</i> who
sat in self-conscious dignity and evening
dress at the desk near the main door. He
referred the journalist to a short fat man
with a white beard, lounging a few feet away,
and Jules stood apart while the two had an
animated talk. After a few moments, Durand
made a sign to Jules to come up, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
Jules found himself presented to Réju as
&quot;my <i>confrère</i>, Monsieur Jules Le Baron, of
the Marseilles <i>Gazette</i>.&quot; Réju was very amiable,
and Jules felt angry, though he could
not help being amused by Durand's serene
impudence.</p>

<p class="indent">They were conducted at once into the
theatre, under the great arch, draped with
French flags, where the performers made
their exits and their entrances. Then they
found themselves in a large bare room, with
several passages radiating from it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The dressing-rooms are here,&quot; Réju explained,
pointing to the passages. &quot;Mademoiselle
Blanche's room is number 5. I don't
know whether she has come yet or not. Her
act doesn't begin till ten minutes of eleven.
Wait here, and I'll see if she can receive
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Durand smiled at Jules, and as soon as
Réju was out of hearing, he whispered: &quot;I
hope you didn't mind that little fairy-tale
of mine. I had to pass you off as one of
the fraternity. If I hadn't they wouldn't
have let you come in. Now, don't forget
your part, the Marseilles <i>Gazette</i>. It's a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
republican paper. The editor's a great friend
of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid I sha'n't be a credit to the
profession. I've never seen any one interviewed
in my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then it'll be an education to you.&quot;
Durand laughed. &quot;Look out. Here he
comes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The fat little manager approached them
with a smiling face; he evidently had in
mind two free advertisements for the theatre.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mademoiselle Blanche,&quot; he said impressively,
&quot;arrived five minutes ago, and she
hasn't begun to dress yet. If you'll have
the kindness to follow me, messieurs&quot;&mdash;he
concluded with a bow and a wave of the
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules' body was tingling, and his heart beat
violently. Durand, on the contrary, seemed
more debonair than ever; with an air of
importance, he strutted behind the manager,
as if conferring an honor on the performer
by his call. Réju rapped on the door, and
after a moment a shrill voice piped:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Entrez!</i>&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span></p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<p class="indent">Durand made a bold entrance, and
Jules followed sheepishly. The room
was small and uncarpeted; on one side stood
a wardrobe and a table, and on the opposite
wall hung a large mirror that reflected nearly
the whole of the apartment. The rest of the
furniture consisted of two wooden chairs
and a large trunk. Jules did not realize
that he had observed these details till afterward,
for his glance was bent on the face of
Mademoiselle Blanche, who stood beside the
trunk, surveying her callers with apprehension
in her big eyes. On one of the chairs sat
a woman of fifty, tall and thin, with strands
of flesh hanging at her neck, her eyes bright,
her lips aglow with a false bloom, and her
cheeks pallid with powder. Jules recognized
her at once as the acrobat's mother, and he
had a shock of surprise and revulsion.</p>

<p class="indent">The manager, after presenting the callers
to Madame Perrault, and then to her daughter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
excused himself with a flourish, and left
the room. Madame Perrault was smiling
and chattering at Durand, and Mademoiselle
Blanche was flushed and confused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think we must be the first of the
Parisian journalists to interview Mademoiselle,&quot;
said Durand to the mother, letting
his eyes turn vaguely to the acrobat for information.</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault gave a little jump, and
glanced hastily at her daughter's face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you are,&quot; she replied. &quot;We did
have&mdash;that is, there was a gentleman of the
press who wanted to interview Blanche, but
she&mdash;she was a little timid about it. Blanche
is very timid; so we&mdash;we put it off. But
interviewers are very&mdash;&mdash;Ah, you will sit
down, will you not?&quot; she said to Jules, who
had remained standing with his eyes fixed
on the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Mademoiselle Blanche had taken a seat on
the trunk, and her mother sat beside her so
that Jules might occupy her chair. When
they were all adjusted, Madame Perrault
resumed, turning to Jules, whose embarrassment
she had observed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
&quot;Monsieur Réju told me yesterday interviews
were so important. They make people
interested. They&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the people are already interested in
Mademoiselle Blanche,&quot; Durand interposed,
gallantly. &quot;That's why my <i>confrère</i> and I
have come here. The Parisians want to
know all about Mademoiselle. She's the
sensation of the hour. Her name is on
everybody's lips.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He glanced at Mademoiselle Blanche with
his most languishing smile, and Jules felt a
sudden desire to kick him. The acrobat
tried to look pleased, but she succeeded
only in appearing more confused. Jules
was surprised to see how frail she was. Her
figure, full and vigorous in the ring, seemed
so thin in her plain, tight-fitting gray dress,
that he felt sure she must have been padded
for her performance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going to ask Mademoiselle a great
many questions,&quot; Durand resumed, still leering
at the acrobat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I have nothing to tell,&quot; she replied,
speaking for the first time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you must have been born, and grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
up, and done a great many things besides,
that the rest of us don't do,&quot; the journalist
laughed, growing more familiar. Jules' dislike
for him was rapidly developing into
hatred.</p>

<p class="indent">Durand's familiarity, however, seemed to
please the acrobat's mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blanche is too modest,&quot; she said. &quot;She's
had a great many things happen to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you always been in the circus,
Mademoiselle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, ever since she was a child,&quot; her
mother answered. &quot;Her father was an
acrobat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it's in the family. And were you in
the circus too, Madame?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault shook her head, and
Jules thought he saw her blush under the
powder. &quot;No, I have never been in public
life. My husband's family lived in Boulogne,
where I lived too. They were all acrobats.
After my marriage I used to travel with the
circus, and when Blanche was born, Monsieur
Perrault wanted her to perform, too. When
she was only five years old, they used to
appear together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
&quot;Then you have travelled a great deal,
Mademoiselle?&quot; Durand turned his fascinating
glance on the girl. She looked at her
mother, and as she was about to reply, Madame
Perrault resumed: &quot;Ah, my daughter
has been over nearly the whole world,&mdash;in
England, in Germany, in Russia&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you ever been in America?&quot; Jules
asked quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">The acrobat shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she has had such offers&mdash;such splendid&mdash;such
magnificent offers to go there,&quot;
the mother cried, clasping her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I'm afraid,&quot; the girl murmured,
glancing at Jules with her big timid eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afraid of the voyage?&quot; Jules asked. Her
eyes were still fixed upon him, and he felt as
if every nerve in his body were vibrating.
&quot;That's nothing. I have made it twice,
and I wasn't sick a day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was not true, for on each trip Jules
had been sick for several days; but he made
the remark with such ease, that for the
moment he felt convinced himself of its
truth. Mademoiselle Blanche looked at him
admiringly, and he saw that he had made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
an impression on the mother, too, established
himself in her regard as a travelled
person, a man of importance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then Monsieur has been in America?&quot;
said Madame Perrault.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Jules replied, carelessly. &quot;All
over it. It's a wonderful country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mademoiselle Blanche sighed, and her
mother glanced at her wistfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it's too far,&quot; Madame resumed with
a shake of the head. &quot;We could not go
so far from the children.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you have other children?&quot; said
the journalist. &quot;Are they in the circus,
too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time, the girl's face brightened.
&quot;Oh, no!&quot; she replied, with a suggestion
of horror in her tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are very young,&quot; the mother explained.
&quot;Jeanne is only fourteen and
Louise will be eleven next month. They are
with my sister in Boulogne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Durand made a little sign of impatience
which indicated to Jules that he was not
getting the information he wanted. Besides,
he was evidently displeased by the failure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
of his leers to produce any apparent effect
upon the girl; she seemed to be unconscious
of them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Monsieur Perrault,&quot; he said, &quot;he
is still performing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">An expression of pain appeared in the
mother's face, and Mademoiselle dropped
her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he died three years ago,&quot; Madame
Perrault replied. &quot;He was killed at Monte
Carlo. He fell from the trapeze.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was silence for a moment, and the
journalist tried to infuse into his insipid
little face a look of sympathy. Just how
much sympathy he felt was shown by his
next remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn't help wondering last night,&quot;
he said briskly, &quot;when I saw Mademoiselle
perform, how she felt just before she took
that plunge. How do you feel, Mademoiselle?
Aren't you frightened, just a little?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl shook her head. &quot;I have done
it for so many years, I don't think of being
afraid. My father taught me never to have
the least fear. He wouldn't have been
killed if the trapeze hadn't broken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
&quot;And we take every precaution,&quot; Madame
Perrault quickly explained.</p>

<p class="indent">Durand began to ask questions about the
various cities Mademoiselle had visited.
Most of the replies came from Madame Perrault,
who seemed to have constituted herself
her daughter's mouthpiece. Which
audiences did she like best to play to?
The Germans! Durand shook his head.
He wouldn't dare to say that in a French
paper. It might make Mademoiselle unpopular
with the Parisians. Ah, but Mademoiselle
liked the Parisians, too. Didn't she
find them very enthusiastic? No? That
was simply because they were thrilled, overcome,
silenced by her performance. Durand
grew excited in extolling the merits of Parisian
audiences. For their favorites they
would do anything, and Mademoiselle was
fast becoming one of the most popular of
their favorites. Of course they had their
peculiarities. When a performer vexed them,
there were no limits to their wrath. Had
Mademoiselle heard of the attack on Sophie
Lenoir at the <i>Ambassadeurs</i>? The audience
had thrown at her everything they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
could lay hands on, and she had fainted, or
pretended to faint, on the stage.</p>

<p class="indent">Indeed, much of the conversation was supplied
by the journalist himself. He had
apparently abandoned hope of making the
acrobat talk; so he addressed most of his
speeches to the mother, whom he drew out by
many artful devices. Mademoiselle Blanche
sat looking on in open-eyed surprise, as if she
did not have a share in the matters under
discussion. Occasionally she would glance
appealingly at Jules; when he looked back,
she would blush and turn her head away.</p>

<p class="indent">While Durand was in the middle of one
of his stories, Madame Perrault drew a small
gold watch from her pocket. The journalist
jumped from his chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are keeping Mademoiselle from
dressing,&quot; he said, as Jules rose, too. &quot;A
thousand pardons. We will go in just a
moment. There's only one more question.
That is about your presents, Mademoiselle,
your gifts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My gifts?&quot; the acrobat repeated vaguely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, from the princes, the crowned
heads you've appeared before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
&quot;Ah!&quot; the mother exclaimed, in a long
breath, &quot;Blanche has received so many!
There was the brooch from the Emperor
of Russia, and the ring from the Prince
of Roumania, a costly diamond, monsieur, so
clear and beautiful, and the little gold watch
studded with pearls from the King of
Bavaria, the 'mad King' they call him, you
know&mdash;and then&mdash;then the bracelet set
with rubies from the Duchess of Merlino,
when Blanche was in Bucharest. Ah, but
we have none of these here. They are all
at home, they&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here in Paris?&quot; Durand asked, impatiently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, monsieur, in Boulogne,&quot; Madame
Perrault answered, and Jules saw an expression
of wonder and pain cross her daughter's
face.</p>

<p class="indent">Durand was rubbing his silk hat with his
glove, and regarding it intently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then,&quot; he said, looking up quickly,
&quot;there must have been some adventures&mdash;some
admirers, that have followed Mademoiselle,
perhaps, eh?&quot; he added, leering
insinuatingly at the mother.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
Madame smiled, and the face of the
acrobat turned pink. Jules wanted to seize
the little journalist by the neck, and throw
him out of the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, in Bucharest,&quot; cried Madame, &quot;the
young&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault shrugged her shoulders,
and smiled suggestively. &quot;Perhaps we'd
better not speak of that. Blanche is a good
girl,&quot; she added, patting her daughter on
the back. &quot;She's good to her mother, and
she's good to her sisters. Ah, <i>ma chère</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl had turned her head away.
Durand offered her his hand gallantly, and
then beamed on the mother. &quot;I will come
and see you some time, if you will give
me permission,&quot; he said condescendingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some Sunday,&quot; Madame Perrault replied.
&quot;It's the only day when Blanche is free.
And you will bring your friend, perhaps,
if he is still in Paris,&quot; she added amiably,
with a quick glance and smile at the journalist
from Marseilles. Then she produced
two cards and passed them to the callers.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules murmured a civil response to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
invitation, and, after bowing low to the ladies,
he followed Durand and closed the door
behind him. The expression of languishing
pleasure in the journalist's face had given
place to a look of hilarious merriment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you ever see such a block? She
didn't have a word to say. I don't believe
she has an idea. And she thought she was
impressing me with her modesty! And the
gifts from the crowned heads&mdash;wasn't that
droll? Of course, the old lady made up
every one of those stories. She's a sharp
one, with her painted lips and her powdered
cheeks. Her little game is to get a rich
husband for the girl, and I'll wager a week's
salary she'll succeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules said nothing. He knew it would be
useless to argue with Durand. If he were
to give his opinion of Mademoiselle Blanche,
the journalist would laugh, and say he didn't
understand women, especially actresses. So,
when Durand suddenly asked him what he
thought of the girl, he merely shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">As they passed out they met Réju, who
offered them seats if they cared to remain for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
the rest of the performance. Durand explained
that he must return at once to the
office, and urged Jules to accept the invitation.
When Jules found himself alone in
the first row of the orchestra he breathed
with relief. He had never before realized
what an odious little creature Durand was.
For the moment he forgot even to feel gratitude
for the introduction to the acrobat.</p>

<p class="indent">He was unable to take an interest in the
performance, and he looked at his watch to
see how long he would have to wait for the
appearance of Mademoiselle Blanche. It was
just twenty minutes past ten. Suddenly it
occurred to him that he would have time
to go out and buy some flowers for her.
He left his seat, and hurried to the nearest
shop in the <i>Boulevard</i>. There he bought
the finest bunch of white roses he could
find, went back to the theatre, and sent
them to the acrobat with his card. When
at last Mademoiselle Blanche ran into the
arena, he was thrilled with joy. She wore
his flowers in her belt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span></p>

<h2>V</h2>

<p class="indent">That night Jules Le Baron knew that
for the first time in his life he was
really in love. He had often fancied himself
in love before, and he had enjoyed the
experience; now he discovered his mistake.
Love was not the pure delight he had imagined
it to be. It is true, he had moments
of ecstasy, of sublime self-congratulation,
when he felt with stronger conviction that
the world was made for him and he had been
created to conquer the world; but during the
next few days these were followed by long
periods of depression, of abject despair.</p>

<p class="indent">At times, too, the grotesqueness of this
infatuation appalled him. To be in love
with an acrobat, a woman who earned her
bread by hurling herself from the top of a
building, who risked her life every day, sometimes
twice a day, that she might live! Then,
at the thought of her amazing courage, Jules
would be overcome, and if alone in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
room at home, he would throw himself on the
bed, bury his head in the pillow and groan.
Indeed, at this period he went through many
strange and violent performances. Madeleine
became alarmed for his health, and
thought of sending for a doctor.</p>

<p class="indent">He could not apply himself to his work;
he made so many mistakes in his English
correspondence that Monsieur Mercier had
to ask him to be more careful. The twins
noticed his condition and chaffed him, and
insisted on knowing &quot;her name&quot;; in secret
they decided that Jules had been investing
his money badly; he had often boasted to
them about his little property. They tried
to cheer him by urging him to join them in
their nocturnal expeditions, but he always
replied that he was staying at home in the
evening now. As a matter of fact, he spent
every night or a portion of every night at the
<i>Cirque Parisien</i>, and at each appearance of
Mademoiselle Blanche, he was gratified to see
that she wore his nightly offering of roses in
her belt. He never received an acknowledgment
of these tributes, for he did not
dare write his address on the cards he sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
with them. Once, as she stood in the net,
just before climbing the rope to make her
great plunge, he fancied that his eye caught
hers, and she smiled at him. He decided
afterward that he had been mistaken; but
the thought of that smile prevented him
from sleeping half the night.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules was keeping his courage alive in the
hope of seeing her at her apartment on Sunday.
His only fear was that Durand would
be there. Durand's published interview with
Mademoiselle Blanche was so flippant that it
deepened the hatred Jules had already conceived
for the journalist. He resolved on
Sunday to explain to Madame Perrault that
he was not what Durand had represented
him to be and to appear in his own character;
he was conceited enough to believe that
in his own character he could make quite as
good an impression as in any other. Besides,
had not Mademoiselle Blanche been
impressed by the fact that he had visited
America?</p>

<p class="indent">On Saturday night he sent his silk hat
to be blocked, and his frock-coat to be
pressed, and he bought a pair of white gloves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
Madeleine found him much more agreeable
on Sunday morning than he had been during
the week; but, though he seemed to be
recovering his spirits, she still felt worried.
In the afternoon he presented himself before
her for inspection, asked if his coat set well,
if she liked the colour of his gloves, what she
thought of the violets that he wore. She
became enraptured over his appearance, told
him that he had never looked so beautiful,
and saw him go away with a radiant face.
Then, as the door closed behind him, she
went into her little chamber and wept. The
truth had flashed upon her! Her Jules was
in love! Some one else was going to take
his mother's place and hers. She felt all the
jealousy and misery that his own mother
might have felt at the moment, combined
with a pathetic consciousness that she had
no right to grieve. Jules was everything in
the world to her, she said to herself, and she
was nothing to him. She was an old broken
woman, and for the rest of her days she
should have to live alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules had become her pride and the source
of her happiness. Yet she really saw very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
little of him&mdash;the only meal he took at home
was his breakfast&mdash;but she really existed for
the pleasure of serving him and looking at
his face in the morning. Now, in spite of
her misery, she knelt before the statue of
the Blessed Virgin that stood on a little table
beside her bed, and prayed that the woman
who was going to take her place might be a
good woman, and worthy of her boy. In
her simple affection for Jules she believed
that he had only to show that he cared for
a woman to have her throw herself into his
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">It was hardly three o'clock, too early for a
call, Jules thought, as he walked toward the
<i>rue St. Honoré</i>; but he was so impatient
to see Mademoiselle Blanche again that he
could not wait till later in the afternoon.
During the week the sun had hardly appeared,
and the succession of leaden skies
had helped to depress his spirits. To-day,
however, the sky was blue and the sun shone
so brightly that it seemed almost like spring.
He was in one of his buoyant moods, when
he felt sure of his ability to conquer. In
his fine clothes and with his confident manner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
he looked very handsome; several pretty
girls gratified him by staring at him as he
passed. If he impressed people he didn't
know, why couldn't he impress Mademoiselle
Blanche? He planned a great many things
to say to her. He would be particularly
amiable to the mother, too, and tell her all
about America.</p>

<p class="indent">The number in the <i>rue St. Honoré</i> that
Madame Perrault had given corresponded
with one of the great white stucco apartment
houses abounding in Paris. He passed
under the wide vaulted entrance, and asked
the wife of the <i>concierge</i> if Madame Perrault
lived there. &quot;<i>Au sixième</i>,&quot; was the
shrill reply, and he started up the narrow
stairs. When he reached the <i>sixième</i>, the top
floor of the house, he panted and waited for
a moment before ringing, to catch his breath.
Then he carefully arranged his cuffs, touched
with his gloved hand his silk cravat and his
flowers and, with a sigh of anticipation, he
rang the bell.</p>

<p class="indent">A trim little servant of not more than
fifteen opened the door. When Jules asked
for Madame Perrault, she shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
&quot;She went out an hour ago, monsieur, and
she won't be back till four.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules' heart sank. Of course, mother and
daughter were out together. He was about
to turn away despairingly, but he suddenly
thought of inquiring if Mademoiselle were
at home. The maid nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I say that monsieur wishes to see
her?&quot; she asked, stepping back that he
might enter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you please,&quot; he replied, as he followed
the girl into the little <i>salon</i>. It was furnished
wholly in Japanese fashion; the walls
were hung with Japanese draperies, and a
large thick rug covered the floor. On the
mantel, prettily draped with a wide piece of
flowered silk, stood a number of photographs,
one of them a duplicate of the portrait of
Mademoiselle Blanche that he had seen in
the entrance of the Circus. As Jules glanced
at this, he heard a light step in the adjoining
room, and when he turned, Mademoiselle
Blanche herself was looking at him out of
her dark eyes. She walked toward him,
flushing a little, and extended her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry mamma is not here,&quot; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
said. &quot;She went out only a few minutes
ago, and she'll be back soon. But we&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn't expect any one so early. I
ought to apologize, but I was impatient to
come. Then&mdash;I&mdash;I hoped to find you alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you have,&quot; she laughed, pointing to a
chair near the grate-fire. She wore a dress
of dark silk with little white spots in it that
became her wonderfully, Jules thought.
Around her neck was a piece of muslin,
open at the throat, and muslin encircled her
wrists. Once again Jules was impressed by
the delicacy of her appearance; her skin
had an almost transparent whiteness, and
there was no colour in her cheeks, save
when she flushed, which she did at the least
cause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How pleasantly you are lodged here,&quot;
said Jules, looking around the room. The
apartment was as small as his own, which
he had considered one of the smallest in
Paris.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, we were fortunate to get it. And
it seems so odd&mdash;it belongs to an actress
who's spending the winter in the South
of France. We have taken it furnished.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
&quot;Then you're to be here all the winter?&quot;
said Jules, feasting his eyes on the clear
white forehead, the white neck that he could
see beneath the muslin. How beautiful she
was! His surmise about the teeth had been
correct; they were small and white, with
little bits of red between them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she replied, &quot;I've been engaged
at the <i>Cirque</i> until the first of January.
Then I shall go to Vienna, and appear there
for several months.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; For a moment Jules was silent.
&quot;But you will take a rest before you go
to Vienna?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I should like to go home for Christmas
to be with my sisters. But they will
come to Paris instead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But doesn't it tire you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. It isn't hard. And I never like
to stop. I must keep in practice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant Jules was touched by a
curious sympathy. There certainly was something
pathetic, even abnormal, in the thought
that this frail woman hurled herself six days
in the week from the top of a building.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
Then he was thrilled again by the marvel
of it, by the consciousness that he was sitting
opposite the phenomenon, gazing into her
eyes, hearing her voice, receiving her smiles.
He could think of nothing to say, but he
felt quite happy; he would have liked to
sit there for hours in mute admiration.
Mademoiselle Blanche, however, looked confused;
she seemed to be shaping something
in her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was very kind of you to send the
flowers,&quot; she said at last. &quot;I would have
thanked you before if I had known where
you lived. They were very lovely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His face shone with pleasure at the
thought that she had recognized him as the
sender, and he leaned toward her. &quot;You
needn't thank me,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt repaid
when I saw them in your belt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he told her how he had gone to
the circus every night just to see her; how
he admired her performance, her grace and
skill on the trapeze, her courage in making
the great plunge. As he spoke, her face
kept changing colour. She seemed to him
like a bashful child, and he marvelled at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
ingenuousness, for surely she must be used
to praise. Then he recalled what Durand
had said about her affectation of modesty,
and he wondered if the journalist could have
been right; but when he looked into the
girl's clear eyes he saw nothing but beauty
and truth.</p>

<p class="indent">When he had finished speaking of her
performance, he began to talk about himself,
his favourite topic with women. He
told her about his visit in the United States,
and he made fun of the Americans for drinking
water instead of wine at table, and for
many other customs that had amused him
because they were so unlike the ways of
Parisians. He also imitated the speech of
some of the Americans he had known, and
he was surprised to find that she understood
what he said. She had learned English
from her father, she explained; he had often
performed in London, and she had been
there with him twice. Then he began to
speak with her in English to display his
accomplishment, and he felt disappointed
on discovering that she could converse quite
as fluently, and with a better accent. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
he returned to French, and told her about
his life in Paris, his dear old Madeleine who
kept him so comfortable in his little apartment,
his work at the office, and about
Dufresne and Leroux. She showed no surprise
when he revealed Durand's duplicity;
she merely said that she hadn't liked the
journalist, and her mother had been vexed by
the article. She seemed so interested that
he went back to his early days, before the
death of his father and mother, described
his life at the <i>lycée</i>, his love of sport, his
passion for the circus, his boyish adventures
at Montmartre, his happy days in summer
at Compiègne, his mother's goodness and
her foolish pride in him. He was so unconscious
in his egotism that it was touching
to hear him; Mademoiselle Blanche seemed
to be unconscious of it, too, for she listened
with a serious, absorbed attention. While
he was in the midst of an analysis of his
own qualities, the little clock on the mantel
struck four and Mademoiselle Blanche looked
up quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma will be here very soon now,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
Jules felt a sudden irritation. At that
moment the coming of Madame Perrault
seemed like an intrusion. The reference to
it had the effect of stopping his confidences;
it was as if she had already appeared in
the room. He rose from his seat, and
began to examine the photographs on the
mantel. Then he took up one of them, a
large photograph of a man of more than
fifty, with a white pointed beard, a shock
of iron-grey hair, and laughing eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is this your father, mademoiselle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is my mother's <i>fiancé</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned to her quickly. &quot;Your mother's
<i>fiancé</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. My mother has been engaged a
long time. She would have been married
a year ago but for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, then you don't like it&mdash;you don't
want her to marry again?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should not care&mdash;that is, I should
be glad for Jeanne and Louise. Monsieur
Berthier is very rich, and he has been kind
to the girls. He has offered to give them
a home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
Jules came near laughing. It seemed to
him ridiculous that the old powdered woman
he had seen in the dressing-room of the
Circus should marry again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then how have you prevented the marriage?&quot;
he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I must work,&quot; she replied simply,
&quot;and mamma cannot leave me. If mamma
married Monsieur Berthier, she would have
to stay in Boulogne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; A light broke on Jules. The
mother would not marry until her eldest
daughter was married. So, of course, she
must be anxious to find a husband for Mademoiselle
Blanche. He felt as if Providence
were paving the way toward happiness for
him. For a moment he did not speak again.
Then he said: &quot;But you will marry some
day, and then your mother won't have to
travel with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She flushed, and made a deprecating gesture.
&quot;I shall always stay in the circus,&quot;
she said. &quot;It's my life. I can't think of
any other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he gradually drew her out. She
surprised him by telling him of the monotony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
of her life. With most of the other performers
she had merely a slight acquaintance;
the coarseness of the women and the
vulgarity of the men shocked her. Her
only companion in her travels was her
mother. Yes, it was lonely sometimes not
to know other girls of her own age, and it
was very hard to be separated from Jeanne
and Louise. She worried a great deal about
Jeanne, who had shown a fondness for the
circus. She thought if her mother married,
Jeanne would give up all thought of
becoming a performer. Of course, it
was different with herself; she had been
bred to the circus, but she couldn't bear
the thought of Jeanne's being there, too.
Jeanne was very pretty and lively; Aunt
Sophie was obliged to be strict with her.
Louise was so different, so quiet and simple,
and religious, almost a <i>dévote</i>. As she spoke
of her sisters, Mademoiselle Blanche grew
very animated. Jules blamed himself for
the momentary doubt he had felt about her.
If Durand could only hear her now! But
Durand doubted every woman.</p>

<p class="indent">It was nearly five o'clock when Madame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
Perrault returned. When she saw Jules, she
showed no surprise, but smiled upon him
broadly and extended her hand. Mademoiselle
Blanche lapsed into silence and,
as her mother talked, with a superabundance
of gesture and with tireless vivacity, she
could feel Jules' eyes fixed upon her. She
knew that Jules hardly heard what was being
said, and when he rose to take his departure,
she made no effort to detain him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to come again,&quot; he said
to the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some afternoon, perhaps,&quot; Madame Perrault
suggested amiably. &quot;Blanche always
rests between three and four, but after that
she could see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am at my office till six.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes!&quot; Madame Perrault exclaimed
with a smile. &quot;That wicked journalist! You
must tell him we were vexed with his article.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then may I come in the evening? Perhaps
you'll let me take you to the theatre
some night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault clapped her hands.
&quot;That would be perfect!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mademoiselle Blanche said nothing, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
it was to her that Jules directed his next
remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps to-morrow night; I will come
at eight o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault displayed her gleaming
teeth patched with gold, and her daughter
merely bowed and said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As Jules was putting on his overcoat in the
little hall, he heard a voice say:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Il est très gentil, ce monsieur</i>,&quot; but though
he listened he could not catch the reply.
He was radiantly happy, however. When he
reached the street, he felt like running; with
an effort he controlled himself, and walked
buoyantly home with a smile on his face.
He would take Madeleine out to dinner, as
he used to take his mother when they celebrated
his holidays!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span></p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p class="indent">The next night, promptly at eight o'clock,
Jules appeared in the little <i>salon</i> in
the <i>rue St. Honoré</i>, bearing his offering of
flowers to Mademoiselle Blanche. Madame
Perrault gave him the quiet reception of an
old friend, and he felt as if he had long been
in the habit of calling at the apartment. Madame
Perrault informed him that she had just
risen from dinner, and asked him to drink
a cup of coffee. Then the three figures sat
in the dimly-lighted room and talked; that
is, Jules and Madame Perrault talked, for
Blanche ventured a remark only when a
question was put to her.</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments later, Madame Perrault
went into the next room where she was
occupied with the little maid in making a
dress; so Jules was left alone with her
daughter. They had very little to say to
each other, and Jules was content to sit in
silence and rapt adoration. As he looked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
her, her name kept singing in his mind:
Blanche! He wondered if he should ever
dare to address her in this way. How beautiful
she was as she sat there, the soft light
of the fire falling on her face and hands, and
on the folds of her gown! He was glad she
was so quiet; he hated women that talked
all the time. That was the great fault with
Madame Perrault; if she said less, he would
like her, in spite of her powder and paint.
Since hearing that she was engaged, and
wanted to get her daughter married, Jules'
feelings toward her had softened.</p>

<p class="indent">It was nearly ten o'clock before they left
for the theatre. Jules called a cab, and all
three squeezed into it with a great deal of
laughter on the part of Madame Perrault.
As they rattled over the rough pavement,
the noise was so great that they could not
talk, and Jules gave himself up to contemplating
the serious face of Mademoiselle
Blanche. The thought that he was riding
with her to the scene of her triumphs thrilled
him. He felt as if he were having a share in
her performance, as if her glory were reflected
on him. Ah, if Dufresne and Leroux could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
see him now! How they would be impressed,
and how they would envy him!</p>

<p class="indent">Before bidding his friends good-night, he
asked if he might not take them home; he
would remain till the end of the performance,
anyway, he said. Instead of entering the
theatre at once, he sauntered along the
<i>Boulevard</i> toward the <i>place de la Bastille</i>.
What were the other performers to him?
Without Mademoiselle Blanche the <i>Cirque
Parisien</i> would not be worth visiting. He
did not return to the theatre till it was nearly
time for her to appear. Réju was standing at
the door, and made a sign for him to pass in
without paying. Jules accepted the invitation
with a twinge of conscience. He wondered
what Réju would think if he discovered
Durand's imposition.</p>

<p class="indent">After the performance, Jules waited at the
stage-door for half an hour till Mademoiselle
Blanche appeared again. Then he asked
her and her mother to take supper with
him at one of the restaurants in the <i>Boulevard</i>.
Madame Perrault consented amiably,
and they entered a little <i>café</i>, where a half-dozen
young men and girls were sitting round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
a table, playing cards. Jules wanted to order
a bottle of champagne; but Mademoiselle
Blanche objected; he could scarcely keep
from smiling when she said she would much
rather have beer. So he called for three
bocks and some cheese sandwiches, and over
this simple repast they became very gay.
Madame Perrault was the liveliest of the
three, and she amused Jules by a description
of her <i>fiancé</i>, who had been in love with
her, she said, long before her marriage with
Blanche's father. She seemed to think it
was very droll that he should want to marry
her now; she had told him he would do much
better to marry Blanche, or to wait till Jeanne
grew up. Under the warmth of her humor,
Jules' prejudices against her disappeared,
and he found himself growing fond of her.
At that moment he longed to confide in her,
to tell her all about his infatuation for her
daughter, and to ask her advice about the
best way of pleasing the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">When they had left the <i>café</i>, and Jules
had taken his friends home and dismissed
the cab, he fell again into the depression of
the week before. As he walked to the <i>rue</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
<i>de Lisbonne</i> in the damp night, he blamed
Durand for having introduced him to the Perraults.
If he hadn't met Mademoiselle Blanche
he might have gone on living comfortably,
enjoyed his daily work, his little dinners, his
visits to the theatre, his comfortable apartment,
with Madeleine to look after his wants.
Now he was upset, at sea. He hated the
routine of the office; the vulgar stories of
Dufresne and Leroux disgusted him; the
apartment was cold and lonely; Madeleine
was always interfering with him. He resolved
not to go to the <i>Cirque</i> again; he
would try to forget Mademoiselle Blanche
and her mother's chatter. But when he
went to bed it was of her that he thought,
and he dreamed that he saw her again, in
her white silk tights, climbing hand over
hand to the top of the Circus, tumbling
through the air, and bouncing with a thud to
her feet on the padded net.</p>

<p class="indent">The next morning he felt better, and he
called himself a fool for his misery of the
night before. As he looked back on the
evening, he decided that, of course, if they
hadn't liked him, they would not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
allowed him to take them to the theatre and
back, and to a <i>café</i> for supper. He wondered
what they would think if he called for
them again that night. Perhaps it would be
better to wait for two or three days. But at
the end of the afternoon he felt so impatient
to see Mademoiselle Blanche that he determined
to risk seeming intrusive. So he
bought another bunch of white roses, and at
eight o'clock he reappeared in the apartment.
Madame Perrault greeted him just as
she had done the night before, without a suggestion
of surprise in her manner. This made
him feel so bold that he did not apologize, as
he had intended to do, but took his place by
the fire as if he had a right to be there.</p>

<p class="indent">In this way, Jules Le Baron's courtship
began. It seemed to him a strange courtship.
It taught him a great many things,&mdash;among
others, how little he knew about
women. As he had lived in Paris all of his
thirty years, with the exception of his three
memorable months in America, he thought
he understood women; now he saw his mistake.
He had not led a particularly good
life, though it was so much better than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
lives of most of his acquaintances that he
considered himself a man of rather superior
character. If he had studied his character
more carefully, he would have discovered
that his superiority was not a matter of
morals, but of taste and temperament. Vice
seemed to him vulgar, and it made him uncomfortable;
so in its grosser forms he had
always avoided it. He had, however, the
Parisian's frank, ingenuous, almost innocent
fondness for the humorously indecent, and
his attitude toward life was wholly French.
The mention of virtue made him laugh and
shrug his shoulders. Most women, he thought,
were naturally the inferiors of men; so the
better he understood the character of Mademoiselle
Blanche, the more surprised he
grew. Indeed, there were times when he
felt awed in her presence and ashamed of
himself. She seemed to know the world
and yet to be untainted by it, to turn away
instinctively from its evil phases. If her
innocence had been ignorant, he could not
have respected it; the knowledge that she
had lived in the midst of temptation made
her goodness seem almost sublime.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
Jules fell into the habit of calling for the
Perraults in the evening, and he soon became
recognized at the <i>Cirque</i> as their escort.
Réju, who still showed respect for him as a
journalist, admitted him to the theatre every
night without charge, and he was also permitted
to enter the sacred precincts beyond
the stage-door, where, instead of waiting on
the sidewalk, he stood in a cold corridor,
dimly lighted by sputtering lamps. After
the performance, he sometimes took his
friends into the little <i>café</i> for beer and sandwiches,
and occasionally Madame Perrault
would prepare a supper at home.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules' equilibrium became restored again;
he made fewer mistakes at the office and he
even deceived the twins, who had come to
the conclusion that he must be in love. With
Madeleine, in spite of his first confidences,
he had little to say about Mademoiselle
Blanche, and she did not dare ask him
questions. His silence and his improved
appetite, together with his renewed amiability,
made her hope that he had recovered
from his infatuation, and she felt easier in
mind.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
On the Saturday evening following his first
call on Mademoiselle Blanche, while Jules
was sitting in the little apartment, he asked
the girl if they might not pass Sunday together.
&quot;We might drive through the <i>Bois</i>
into the country,&quot; he suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">She had been looking into the fire, and
she glanced at him hesitatingly. &quot;We always
go to mass on Sunday morning,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Jules appeared confused.
&quot;But can't you go to early mass?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault, who was in the next
room, called out: &quot;It's no use trying to
persuade her not to go to high mass,
monsieur. She'd think something terrible
was going to happen to her if she didn't go.
Now, I go at eight o'clock; so I have the
rest of the day free.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules looked at Mademoiselle Blanche and
smiled, and she smiled back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like to hear the music,&quot; she explained
apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she's too religious for <i>this</i> world,&quot;
Madame Perrault laughed. &quot;I believe she'd
go to mass every morning of her life if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
didn't have to stay up so late at night.
She ought to be in a convent instead of a
circus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In a convent!&quot; Jules exclaimed, in mock
alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you ever go to church?&quot; the girl
asked, turning to Jules.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked confused again. &quot;I? Well, no.
To tell the truth, I haven't been in a church
for nearly ten years. Oh, yes I have. I went
to a funeral two years ago at the Trinity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But weren't you&mdash;weren't you brought
up to go to church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brought up to go to church? Oh, yes;
my mother went to church every Sunday
of her life. I used to go with her after my
father died.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A long silence followed. Mademoiselle
Blanche turned again to the fire, and Jules
had a sensation of extreme unpleasantness.
Like many Parisians, he never thought about
religion. He had been so affected by the
skepticism of his associates that he had no
real belief in any doctrine. He saw now
for the first time that serious complications
might arise from his religious indifference.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
It was very disagreeable, he thought, to be
confronted with it in this way. Indeed, the
more he thought about it, the more annoyed
he became. He felt that he must justify
himself in some way. So at last he spoke up:
&quot;I suppose you're shocked because I don't
go to church, aren't you, mademoiselle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mademoiselle Blanche looked down at her
hands lying folded in her lap.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sorry?&quot; he repeated, trying to laugh.
&quot;Why are you sorry? I rather like it.
I never did enjoy going to church.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We don't go to church to enjoy it, do
we?&quot; she asked gently.</p>

<p class="indent">He sank back in his seat, and looked
at her. &quot;No, I suppose not.&quot; Then, after
a moment, he suddenly leaned forward.
&quot;We can't all be good like you, mademoiselle.
Perhaps if I had known you
always, I should go to church. I'd do
anything to please you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you ought not to go to please me.
You ought to go for your own good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you think it does good, then&mdash;going
to church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
&quot;I'm sure of it,&quot; she replied, gazing into
the fire. &quot;Sometimes,&mdash;when I feel unhappy
because I haven't seen the girls for
so long, and because I must be separated
from them so much, or when Aunt Sophie
complains about Jeanne, or Jeanne has been
unkind to Louise, or disobedient, then, after
I've been to church, I feel better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you feel better?&quot; he asked,
more to keep her talking than because he
cared for her answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I feel sure,&quot; she went on, holding
her head down, &quot;I feel sure it will all
come out right&mdash;if I only have faith.
Jeanne is a good girl; she's never disobedient
or unkind with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you worry about Jeanne?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you don't worry so much after
you've been at church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that is why you like to go to
church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's one reason. But there are others&mdash;a
great many others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He felt like laughing at the simplicity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
her reasoning, and yet he was touched.
He had a sudden desire to take her in his
arms and stroke her soft hair and tell her
he loved her. Then he heard her mother's
step in the next room, and this roused
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to go to church with you
sometimes,&quot; he said. &quot;May I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take him to-morrow, Blanche,&quot; cried
Madame Perrault, and at that moment Jules
could have kissed her, too. &quot;There's going
to be a special service at <i>St. Philippe de Roule</i>
at ten o'clock. The music will be good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That was how Jules first happened to go
to church with Mademoiselle Blanche. After
mass they walked up the <i>Champs Élysées</i> and
then along the <i>avenue du Bois de Boulogne</i>,
in the midst of the multitude of promenaders.
A few of the men recognized the girl, and
turned to look after her. She seemed not
to see them, but Jules did, and he felt very
proud to be her escort. She looked very
pretty in her tight-fitting black jacket and
little hat tipped with fur, her cheeks scarlet
with the early frost. She was the last person
in the crowd, Jules thought, who would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
taken for an acrobat. It seemed to him
wonderful that she should appear so unlike
the marvel that she was, and this lack of
resemblance to herself made her the more
attractive to him.</p>

<p class="indent">After that day, Jules went to church with
Mademoiselle Blanche every Sunday. At first
the sight of the priests in their vestments,
of the altar-boys in their white surplices, of
the white altar gleaming with candles and
plate and enshrouded in incense, and the
reverberation of the organ, mingled with
the voices singing the music of the mass,
all reminded him so strongly of his mother,
that his old affection for her swept over
him, and brought tears to his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">His own disbelief had made him doubt
even the faith of others. It had also inspired
him with the hatred for priests, so
common even among Parisians of traditions
like his own. Now, as he watched them,
chanting at the altar, they seemed harmless
as other men. He tried, as he went mechanically
through the service, to count the men
he knew who went to church. Nearly all
of his acquaintances, he found, scoffed at it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
Then gradually the service became subtly
mingled with his love for the girl beside him,
and for her sake he loved it. The organ
seemed to sing her praise exultingly. He
would have liked to tell her of this fancy,
but he did not dare; he knew it would
shock her. In a short time, going through
the mass with her grew to mean to him an
expression of his love, a spiritual exaltation
which he offered as a tribute, not to God,
but to her.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span></p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<p class="indent">By the month of November, Jules had
identified himself with Madame Perrault
and her daughter. He took his position
as their friend and recognized escort
so quickly and so quietly that he was himself
surprised by it. There were moments when
he had a fear that it was all an illusion, that
some night he should find the stage-door
of the <i>Cirque</i> slammed in his face.</p>

<p class="indent">It was while watching Mademoiselle Blanche
in the ring that he found it most difficult to
realize his happiness. He actually <i>knew</i> this
wonderful creature in white tights who darted
from trapeze to trapeze, who posed like
a marble statue on the rope, who shot
through the air like a thunderbolt! He saw
her every day; he loved her, and she knew
that he loved her. Sometimes he fancied
that she loved him in return&mdash;from an expression
in her face, a glance of her eyes,
a blush, a tremor when his hand touched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
hers. He did not dare speak to her about
his love; he doubted if he should ever dare
to speak; at a word he feared his happiness
might be shattered.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes on Sunday afternoons he drove
with Mademoiselle Blanche and her mother
into the country, and on Sunday nights he
would dine and pass the evening with them
in the little apartment. Occasionally he had
long talks with the mother; in these he told
about his family and about his property,
laying stress on the fact that even if he lost
his place at the office his income was large
enough to support him. She told him, in
return, about her own family and her husband's,
and gave him a humorous account
of her sister-in-law, Blanche's Aunt Sophie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blanche is a little like her,&quot; she said.
&quot;Sophie takes everything <i>au grand sérieux</i>.
Then she's strict with the children, and
that's a great mistake, for Jeanne hates
restraint, and Louise doesn't need it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She also told him amusing stories about
Monsieur Berthier's devotion to her. He
had offered himself to her while she was
at the convent where she was educated, near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
Boulogne, and she had refused him twice.
Her family had objected to her marriage
with Blanche's father, simply because he
was an acrobat. No, she hadn't fallen in
love with him at the circus. She never saw
him perform till a short time before she
became engaged to him. Ah, it had been
hard for her to be separated from him so
much. Sometimes she travelled with him
in his long journeys; but while the children
were very young, she couldn't. Blanche had
been such a consolation to him. Madame
Perrault believed that husband and wife
ought never to be separated; it was bad
for both of them. If she had her life to
live over again, she would always travel with
her husband, no matter how far he went.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of Jules' talk with Madame Perrault,
however, consisted of a discussion of the
qualities of her daughter, whose praises she
constantly sang for him. Blanche's ambition,
she said, was to provide dowries for her
sisters; she had already accumulated a few
thousand francs, and these she had set aside
for the girls. She never seemed to think
that she herself needed a <i>dot</i>. Ah, sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
Madame was very much worried about
her daughter's future. Blanche could not
marry any of the other performers; they
were not worthy of her, and their coarseness
and roughness shocked her. Of course,
they were good enough in their way, but
their way was not Blanche's way.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, as Madame became more familiar
with Jules, she also grew more confidential.
Yes, Blanche had had a great many admirers.
The young Prince of Luperto had fallen
desperately in love with her in Bucharest
three years before, and he had followed her
all over Europe. But she had refused to
notice any of his letters,&mdash;and oh, <i>mon
Dieu!</i> such letters! Madame had read
every one of them, and she had met the
Prince the night he tried to force himself
into Blanche's dressing-room. He seemed
<i>such</i> a gentleman, and he had the most
beautiful eyes! But Blanche,&mdash;she was so
frightened. She cried and cried, and for
weeks she was in terror of her life! Then
there were others,&mdash;so many, so many.
One by one, Madame Perrault unfolded their
histories to Jules, and he listened in rapt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
attention, with a growing appreciation of
the daughter's charms and of the mother's
amiability.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules often wondered why he did not hear
more talk about the circus in the little apartment.
The subject was rarely mentioned.
Mademoiselle Blanche displayed no nervousness
before or after her performance. She
practised a little in the morning at home,
she said, to keep her muscles limber; she
had done the same things on the trapeze
so often that they had become easy to her.
Once Jules met in the apartment the oily
little Frenchman who always held the rope
when Mademoiselle Blanche climbed to the
top of the <i>Cirque</i>, and then he learned for
the first time that Monsieur Pelletier was
Mademoiselle's agent. &quot;And he is such
a trial to us,&quot; the mother explained when
he was gone. &quot;He makes such bad terms,
and we have to pay him such a high percentage;
and then he sometimes mixes up
our dates, and we don't know what to do.
Ah, if we could only have some one to take
care of our affairs that we could trust. It
is so hard for two unprotected women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
Jules thought of this speech many times.
Indeed, he fairly brooded over it. For
several weeks he had felt that his career
was too limited; he hated the thought of
being tied down to his business all his life.
He was made for something better than that,
for a grander, a more conspicuous <i>rôle</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">In his youth he had thought of the army,
then of a diplomatic career; for a time, too,
of the stage. But he had been too poor
to enter either of the first two professions,
and for the stage he was unfitted by temperament.
Now, in his imagination a brilliant
career stretched before him, combining both
glory and love. Up to the present he had
not lived; his life was about to begin. The
world seemed to open out to him! He would
travel from one end of the earth to the
other in an unbroken march of triumph.
Even Paris lost attractiveness for him and
seemed uninteresting and petty; he pitied
the poor <i>boulevardiers</i> who were bound to
a wretched routine of existence, who loved
it simply because they knew of no other.
He would not only visit America again&mdash;this
time not in a sordid capacity, friendless and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
lonely, but surrounded by a retinue&mdash;he
would go also to Russia, to India, to Australia,
perhaps to Japan and the other
countries of the remote East. The night
when he was first enchanted by this vision,
he could not sleep for excitement till nearly
four o'clock. Then he saw the vision realized,
only to be shattered by Madeleine's
cracked voice, and her injunction that it
was time for him to get up and go to his
work.</p>

<p class="indent">In the evening, when he saw his friends
again, he found them very unhappy; they
had just received news from Jeanne that
Aunt Sophie was very ill, threatened with
pneumonia. Madame Perrault was in tears,
and Mademoiselle Blanche's eyes showed
that she, too, had been crying. The next
day, they said, Jeanne had promised to write,
and the next night Jules learned that bad
news had been received. The doctor pronounced
the case pneumonia, and said the
patient was in great danger. Mamma must
come on, Jeanne wrote. But Madame explained
to Jules with sobs that she could
not leave Blanche.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
&quot;And my poor Jeanne, what will she do,
a child of fourteen with only the little Louise
to help her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jules became inspired. His faithful
Madeleine&mdash;she would save the situation.
Madame Perrault might go to Boulogne
by the first train, and Madeleine
would take her place, would be a second
mother to Mademoiselle Blanche, accompany
her to the theatre, help her to dress,
come back with her, keep her from being
lonely. Jules wanted to rush off at once,
and bring Madeleine to the <i>rue St. Honoré</i>,
for inspection and approval.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the girl's quiet wisdom asserted itself.
Jeanne had said there was no immediate
danger; so if Mamma took the train
in the morning, that would be in quite time
enough. After their <i>petit déjeuner</i> they might
call on Madeleine, or Monsieur Jules might
tell them if she would come. Then Jules
burst into a eulogy of Madeleine's qualities:
he had never before realized what a good
soul she was. He would bring her with him,
he said, in the morning, on his way to the
office; he knew she would be glad to come.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
On this occasion Jules had a chance to
display his executive ability. After leaving
his friends at the Circus, he drove home
furiously, found Madeleine sound asleep in
the big chair by the fireplace, woke her up,
and explained the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, my dear Madeleine,&quot; he said at
the end, &quot;you are to go to that poor girl
and take her mother's place; she will love
you, and you will love her. So be good to
her for my sake, Madeleine,&quot; and he leaned
over, and patted the old woman's wrinkled
hand affectionately. Madeleine was moved,
chiefly, however, by Jules' unwonted tenderness.
She had never known an actress, not
to speak of a performer in a circus, and she
felt alarmed at the thought of meeting one.
But she felt sure that Mademoiselle Blanche
must be good. Hadn't Jules said so?
Jules had not said that he was in love with
Mademoiselle; he trusted Madeleine to find
that out for herself; he also trusted Madeleine
to find out a few other things for him.
Secretly he was blessing the chance that
enabled him to send Madeleine to Mademoiselle;
for the moment he did not even think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
of the personal discomfort it would cause
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">That night Jules told his friends that
Madeleine had consented to come, and he
promised to bring her with him in the
morning. Madeleine was greatly agitated,
and rose unusually early to make an elaborate
toilette. She rarely went out, save to
the shops and to mass; so she had not kept
up with the fashions, and her best dress was
made in a mode long before discarded.
She was a very grotesque figure as she
walked in her queer little bonnet with long
ribbons flying from it, and her wide skirts.
When they reached the apartment in the
<i>rue St. Honoré</i>, Jules thought he saw an
expression of amusement in Madame Perrault's
face, but Blanche greeted Madeleine
with great kindliness. Then the mother
explained that she had just received a letter
from Jeanne, saying Aunt Sophie was in no
immediate danger, but begging her to come
as soon as possible. Jules saw that both his
friends were pleased with Madeleine, and it
was quickly arranged that she should install
herself in the apartment that day, and at four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
o'clock Madame Perrault would leave for
Boulogne. He departed radiantly happy,
with the promise to return at three to take
Madame to the station. He secured leave of
absence from the office, and on his return to
the apartment he found Madeleine there,
helping Mademoiselle Blanche to make a
new dress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll be ready in a minute,&quot; Madame Perrault
cried from the adjoining room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you coming with us, mademoiselle?&quot;
Jules asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I won't let her,&quot; her mother replied.
&quot;It's too cold, and it would tire her. You
aren't afraid to ride alone in a cab with me,
are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules was surprised by her vivacity; he
knew that she was greatly worried about her
sister, yet in the midst of her agitation she
could joke. If he had known her less he
would have supposed that she was a woman
of little feeling. She presently flounced out
of the room, putting on her gloves and
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madeleine and Blanche have become
great friends,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm afraid I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
be jealous of her. When I come back there
won't be any place for me.&quot; Then she took
her daughter by both hands and Jules saw
the glimmer of tears in her eyes. &quot;Good-bye,
dear,&quot; she said, kissing the girl on both
cheeks. &quot;You must write to me every day,
and I'll write to you. In a week, at least, I
shall be back. I have a presentiment that
Sophie will improve as soon as I get
there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mademoiselle Blanche clung tightly to her
mother, and kissed her again and again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, there! Now, my child&mdash;there!&quot;
With a parting embrace, Madame Perrault
tore herself away, crying as she passed out of
the door, &quot;Good-bye, Madeleine. Take
care of the little one! And remember
Monsieur Jules is coming back to dinner.
I'm going to invite him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was the first time she had ever
called Jules by his first name, and on hearing
it he felt a thrill of joy. She hurried before
him down the steep stairs, wiping her eyes.
When they entered the cab, she had controlled
herself again, and was smiling as
usual.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
The cab rattled so noisily over the pavement
that during most of the ride to the
station they kept silent. They arrived there
half an hour ahead of time, and this they
spent in walking up and down the platform.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must be very kind to my Blanche
while I'm away,&quot; said Madame Perrault.
&quot;She will be very lonely. She hasn't been
separated from me before since her father
died.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules assured her that he would be a
second mother to her. He would take her
and Madeleine to the <i>Cirque</i> every night,
and in the morning on his way to the office
he would call to ask if he could do her
any service. &quot;She'll be spoiled when you
come back,&quot; he concluded with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment they walked without speaking.
The station was so cold that their
breaths made vapour in the air. Yet Jules
felt warm enough; his whole being seemed
to glow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's something I want to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made a sign with her head that she
was listening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm in love with Mademoiselle Blanche,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
he said, impressively, finding a delicious
relief in speaking the words.</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled roguishly into his face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They looked into each other's eyes, and
read there a mutual understanding.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you've known all along?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, from the very first, from the
first night you came into the dressing-room,
and pretended to be a reporter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, I thought you had forgiven that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I have&mdash;that is, there was nothing
to forgive. You didn't deceive me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean that you knew at the time
I wasn't a reporter? And Blanche&mdash;she
knew too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, poor dear, she didn't know. Yet it
was plain as daylight. Ah, my friend, I
haven't lived fifty years for nothing. Don't
you suppose I could tell from your looks and
your manner, and what you said, and what
you <i>didn't</i> say,&mdash;don't you suppose I could
tell from all that, what you had come for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules looked into her face again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How good you are!&quot; he sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">She burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
&quot;Good? I am not good. Blanche taught
me that years ago. There's nothing like
having a good daughter to take a mother
down. She makes me feel ashamed every
day of my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's just the way she makes me feel,&quot;
Jules cried, delighted to find that some one
else shared his feeling. &quot;Then she's so
gentle and so kind,&quot; he rhapsodized, &quot;and she
thinks so little about herself! Do you&mdash;do
you think&mdash;&mdash;Oh, that's what almost drives
me to despair sometimes. I hardly dare go
near her. I hardly dare to speak to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault took a deep breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You almost make me feel young again,&quot;
she said, with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think I could make her love
me?&quot; Jules asked, marvelling at his own
humility.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean that you want to know
whether I think she's in love with you or
not?&quot; Madame Perrault said briskly. &quot;Ah,
my friend, I can't answer that question.
You must ask her yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you give me permission to ask her?
You are willing? You have no objection?&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
He stopped suddenly, and looked radiantly
at Madame Perrault's face. &quot;How <i>good</i> you
are, madame!&quot; he repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">She began to laugh again,&mdash;a peculiar,
gurgling laugh that came from her throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should I object? You are a good
fellow. You would make Blanche a good
husband. It's time for her to get married.
She needs some one to protect her. I can't
follow her about all the rest of my life.
She is twenty-two. Why shouldn't she
marry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules' ardor was cooled by this practical reasoning;
it made him practical too. He told
Madame Perrault again of his little property.
He could well afford to marry, he said. He
loved Mademoiselle Blanche with all his
heart; he couldn't live without her; he
would give up everything for her; he would
follow her everywhere. Ah, if he only knew
whether she cared for him or not! She was
so strange, so reserved. It was so hard to
tell with a girl like her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are right there, my friend. She has
great reserve. With my Jeanne or Louise, I
should know everything. But with Blanche,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
<i>non!</i> But I never pry into her secrets; I
have learned better. She has a great deal of
inner life; she thinks a great deal; she is
not like the other flighty women that you see
in the circus. If she had not been born to
the circus, if she had been brought up as
Louise has been, she would be a <i>religieuse</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules would have become rhapsodical again
if the whistle of the train had not sounded,
and he was obliged hurriedly to help Madame
Perrault into her compartment. He shook
the hand that she offered him, received a
few last messages, and he watched the train
as it pulled out of the station. Then, with a
sigh, he turned and walked back to his
office.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span></p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p class="indent">After the departure of Madeleine, Jules
would have found his apartment cheerless,
if he had not used it merely for sleeping.
As soon as he rose in the morning, he went
to Madame Perrault's, where he breakfasted
with Mademoiselle Blanche. In spite of her
duties elsewhere, Madeleine kept his rooms in
order, and his new domestic arrangements did
not in the least inconvenience him. Indeed,
he liked them, and he almost dreaded the return
of Mademoiselle's mother. This would
probably not take place for several weeks,
however, for the illness of her aunt Sophie
proved to be very tedious, though after the
first ten days she was pronounced out of
danger. Madeleine had speedily won the
affections of Mademoiselle Blanche, and she
secretly confided to Jules that the girl was
an angel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew you'd think so,&quot; Jules replied.
&quot;I've thought so ever since I first saw her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
&quot;Ah, but it's wicked that she should have
to do those dreadful things every night!&quot;
Madeleine cried, rolling her eyes, and throwing
up her hands in horror. &quot;It freezes my
blood.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she likes it,&quot; Jules explained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, it's wicked just the same, the poor
child!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine had speedily adapted herself to
her duties as dresser to Mademoiselle Blanche,
and her nightly trips to the theatre were the
most exciting experiences of her life. After
seeing the plunge from the top of the Circus,
however, she had refused to look at it again.
&quot;It freezes my blood,&quot; she would repeat,
whenever Jules referred to it. &quot;It's too
horrible!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she makes a lot of money by it,&quot;
Jules insisted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She would do much better to stay poor,&quot;
Madeleine replied, with a tartness that was rare
with her and made Jules burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madeleine,&quot; he said, confidentially. &quot;Madeleine,
come over here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine bent her head towards him with
a smile on her face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
&quot;Madeleine, do you think there's any one&mdash;any
one that she cares about particularly&mdash;any
one you know? Eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine's wrinkles deepened, as the
smile spread over her face and lighted her
faded eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Monsieur Jules, she is very fond of
her sisters. She is always talking about them,
especially about <i>la petite</i> Jeanne. Then she's
very fond of her mamma, too, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madeleine, you're trying to plague me
now. You know I don't mean that. I mean
any&mdash;any&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any gentleman, Monsieur Jules?&quot; the
old woman asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Madeleine, any gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine grew thoughtful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She often speaks of Monsieur Berthier,
who is going to marry her mother. She
says he's very kind to her sisters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And is that all, Madeleine? Doesn't
she speak of any one else? Doesn't she ever
speak of&mdash;of me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, Monsieur Jules, she thinks you've
been very good to her and her mother. She
often speaks of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
This was all the information that Jules
could extract from Madeleine. On several
occasions he tried her again, but though she
seemed amused by his questions, she evaded
them. Once he said to her:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madeleine, how would you like to go
away with me&mdash;to travel&mdash;a long distance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine carefully considered the question.
Then she replied simply:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should not like to leave Paris, Monsieur
Jules, but, if you wanted me to go, I would
go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After that, Madeleine was less worried.
She had little to say, and, like most silent
people, she observed and thought a great
deal. For Mademoiselle Blanche she had
conceived a genuine affection, and she looked
forward with regret to the time when she
would have to leave the <i>rue St. Honoré</i> for
Jules' lonely apartment.</p>

<p class="indent">One Saturday night, on their return from
the Circus, Jules asked Mademoiselle Blanche
if she were going to high mass the next
day as usual. He was surprised when she
replied that she was going at eight o'clock
instead.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
&quot;But that is too early,&quot; he said. &quot;You
won't have sleep enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going to communion,&quot; she explained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He could not understand why this announcement
should impress him as it did.
He had supposed that of course she went
to communion; she had probably gone to
confession early in the afternoon before the
<i>matinée</i>. Once again he felt awed by her
goodness. How strange it was that she
should be in the confessional at three o'clock,
and two hours later perform in her fleshings
before a crowd of people! The very publicity
of her life seemed to exalt the simplicity
and the purity of her character.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules was so absorbed in thinking of these
things that he did not speak again till the
cab reached the <i>rue St. Honoré</i>. Then, as
he helped Mademoiselle out, he said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll go to church with you to-morrow, if
you will let me. You won't leave before half-past
seven, will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She protested that he ought not to get up
so early; he needed a good night's rest
after his hard work of the week. But he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
laughed and waved his hand to her in parting,
and told her not to wait for him after
a quarter to eight; now that he didn't have
Madeleine to call him, he might not wake up
in time.</p>

<p class="indent">He was in time, however, and as he walked
to church in the cold December air with
Mademoiselle by his side, he felt repaid for
his sacrifice. She wore a tight-fitting fur
coat and a black cloth dress, with the little
fur-trimmed hat he had admired when he
first walked with her in the <i>Champs Élysées</i>.
Her face was protected by a thick dotted
veil, but under it he could see her sparkling
eyes and the color in her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm paying you a very great compliment,&quot;
he said, as they hurried along
towards <i>St. Philippe de Roule</i>. &quot;I haven't
got up so early on a Sunday since I was a
boy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled in reply; it was too cold for
her to speak. He could see her breath
steaming faintly through the veil.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt a curious desire to hear her voice
again; he did not realize that her devotion
to the Church made her seem more remote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
from him, but he had an unpleasant consciousness
that his own lack of religious
faith created a barrier between them.</p>

<p class="indent">In the church he kept glancing from the
priest celebrating the mass, to her. She was
absorbed in reading her prayer-book, and
she did not once look up at him. He compared
her as she appeared then with her
appearance in the glamor of the circus ring.
She was the same person, yet different. She
represented to him a kind of miracle. How
humble she was, how sweet and good, as she
knelt there!</p>

<p class="indent">When the priest began to distribute the
communion and Blanche left her seat and
joined the throng approaching the altar,
Jules was touched with a tenderness he had
never felt before. He buried his face in his
hands, and prayed that he might be made
worthy of her. He did not dare pray for
her love; a certain sense of shame at having
neglected God and church for so many years,
at having lived solely for his own gratification,
kept him from that; but if he had
examined his motives, he would have found
that this was really what he was praying for.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
He deceived himself so easily that he instinctively
felt that he might be able to
deceive God too.</p>

<p class="indent">On leaving the church, Jules proposed
that they go to a restaurant for breakfast.
&quot;We'll make a holiday of it,&quot; he said, &quot;and
drink to your Aunt Sophie's health.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Blanche protested that Madeleine
would expect them, and would be worried if
she were not back by half-past nine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we'll go out at one o'clock. I'll
take you over to Bertiny's, in the <i>Champs
Élysées</i>. It's very gorgeous; the twins
took me there once to celebrate Dufresne's
luck when he won five hundred francs at the
races.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Though the sun was shining, it was still
very cold, and as they hurried to the little
apartment Jules could see that she was
trembling. Madeleine had prepared some
hot coffee for them and some eggs, and over
these they were very gay. Jules was in a
particularly good humor, and Mademoiselle
Blanche laughed at his jokes, though most
of them she had heard before. She had a
very pretty laugh, he thought,&mdash;like her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
mother's, though not so deep and gurgling.
After breakfast her face flushed from her
walk and she looked even prettier than she
appeared in the church.</p>

<p class="indent">As Madeleine cleared away the table,
Blanche began to water the flowers by the
window, and Jules opened the copy of the
<i>Petit Journal</i> that he had bought on the way
from the church. He kept glancing up at
Mademoiselle, however, and each time he
looked at her he had a new sensation of
pleasure. How domestic she looked in the
little dress of gray wool that she had put on
after her return from mass! She seemed to
create an atmosphere of home around her.
In her belt were the roses he had given her
the night before, still fresh and sparkling with
drops of water from her fingers. How good
it was, he thought, that he could be with her
like this! How lonely his own apartment
would be to him when Madame Perrault came
back! He almost wished that she would
never return, that she would marry Monsieur
Berthier, and they might go on in this way
forever. He laughed at the thought, and
just then Mademoiselle turned her head.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
&quot;Monsieur seems to be amused,&quot; she said.
&quot;What is he smiling at?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm smiling because I'm so happy,&quot;
Jules replied. &quot;Don't you smile when
you're happy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She took a seat by the table, where she
rested one hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don't think I do,&quot; she said, apparently
giving the question serious consideration.
&quot;When I am very happy I look
serious. Then mamma sometimes fancies I
feel sad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took a cigarette-case from his pocket
and began to smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know,&quot; he said at last, &quot;I
shall be sorry when your mother returns?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sorry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, because Madeleine will come back
to me then, and I shall have to stay at home.
I can't come any more as I do now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A look of alarm appeared in her face.
&quot;But why can't you come just the same?&quot;
she asked, innocently.</p>

<p class="indent">He burst out laughing, and he felt a sudden
desire to pat her on the cheek as he
might have done to a child. What a child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
she was, anyway! Yet he would not have
wished her to be different; she seemed to
him just what a young girl should be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When your mother comes, I can't take
breakfast with you any more, and I can't
come early on Sunday mornings and stay all
day. I shall have to go back to my lonely
apartment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you have Madeleine,&quot; she said, with
a faint smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madeleine, yes, and she is good enough
in her way.&quot; Then he suddenly threw his
cigarette into the fireplace, and bent toward
her. &quot;Don't you know,&quot; he whispered,
in a voice so low that Madeleine, who was
moving about in the next room, could not
hear him, &quot;can't you see that it's <i>you</i> I
shall miss? Can't you see that you've become
everything in the world to me? Without
you, dear Blanche, I shouldn't care to
live. Before I met you I didn't know what
life really was&mdash;I didn't know what love
was. I loved you the first time I saw you,
and the more I've seen you, the better I've
known you, the dearer you've become to
me. I don't think I ever really understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
what it was to be pure and good till I
knew you. You've made me ashamed of
myself. Sometimes I feel as if I had no
right to go near you. But I do love you,
Blanche, and they say love helps a man to
be good. I haven't dared to tell you this
before; I've been afraid to ask you if you
loved me. But this morning in church, it
all came over me so&mdash;so that I must tell
you. Blanche,&quot; he went on, taking her
hand, &quot;you aren't offended with me for
saying this, are you? I love you so much&mdash;I
can't help loving you. If you'll only love
me a little, dear, I'll be satisfied. Won't
you tell me if you do care for me a little&mdash;just
a little?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He knelt by her side, and tried to look
into her face; but she turned her head away,
and he saw that her neck was crimson. Her
bosom kept rising and falling convulsively.
Then he pressed toward her and clasped her
in his arms and kissed her again and again,&mdash;on
the face, the forehead, the hair, even on
her ears when she buried her head on his
shoulder. His lips were wet with her tears,
and he felt radiantly, exultantly happy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
&quot;I love you, I love you!&quot; he kept repeating.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time he felt sure that his love
was returned; but he was not satisfied. He
wanted to hear her speak out her love. His
lips were on her cheek, and she was lying
motionless in his arms, as he whispered:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won't you say that you love me, dear?
Just three words. That isn't much, and it
will make me the happiest man that ever
lived.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Instead of speaking, she put her arms
on his shoulders, as a child might have
done, and he pressed her close to his
breast again. Then he heard a noise behind
him, and he saw Madeleine standing,
big-eyed, in the doorway; she seemed too
startled to move. He rose quickly to his
feet, and still holding Blanche's hand, he
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madeleine, come here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She came forward timidly, as if afraid she
might be punished for her intrusion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mademoiselle Blanche is going to be my
wife, Madeleine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine held out her arms to the girl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
and for a moment they stood clasped in
each other's embrace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Monsieur Jules,&quot; the old woman
cried, &quot;I pray God your mother can look
down from heaven and see what a good
daughter she's getting!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span></p>

<h2>IX</h2>

<p class="indent">After confessing his love, Jules experienced,
mingled with his exultation,
a feeling of bewildered amazement at his
own boldness. This was followed by a poignant
regret that he hadn't spoken before.
Now, however, that his weeks of doubt and
of intermittent misery were over, he gave
himself up to his happiness, which manifested
itself in a wild exuberance of spirits.</p>

<p class="indent">In a short time he was speaking humorously
of those weeks, ridiculing himself as if
he had already become different, almost another
person from what he had been then.
He told Blanche about his tortures, and even
succeeded in extorting a confession from her
that she had been in love with him since the
first Sunday when he had called at the apartment
and acknowledged Durand's duplicity;
she, too, had had her doubts and her fears.
Then they became very confidential, and by
the time the morning was over, and they found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
themselves in the restaurant, they felt as if
they had known each other intimately for
years.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of Blanche's protests, Jules ordered
a bottle of champagne and an elaborate
luncheon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose I ought to have asked Madeleine
to come,&quot; he said, &quot;but I wanted to
be alone with you. Some day before your
mother returns, we'll have another <i>fête</i>, and
take Madeleine with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning, when he spoke about a
definite engagement, and she protested that
her mother must be consulted, he had told
her of his talk with Madame Perrault at the
railway station. Now he went on to make
plans for their marriage. There was no reason,
he argued, why they should wait a long
time; her mother had been engaged to Monsieur
Berthier for three years, but she would
not marry till Blanche had a protector. Jules
liked to talk of himself in this character; it
gave him a feeling of importance. So, altogether,
he went on, the sooner the marriage
took place the better. He would give up
his place in the wool-house, and devote himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
to his wife's career; for, of course, they
couldn't be separated. They would be very
happy travelling about, from one end of the
world to the other.</p>

<p class="indent">It never occurred to either of them that
Blanche might retire from the ring after
marriage. She herself seemed to regard
the circus as part of her life; she had been
born in it, and she belonged to it as long as
she was able to perform. As for Jules, he
could not have dissociated her from the
thought of the circus. Even now he felt as
if he had himself become wedded to it, that
he had acquired a kind of proprietary interest
in it. He discussed Blanche's professional
engagements as if they were his own.
Why, he asked, couldn't the marriage take
place during the weeks that intervened between
her engagement at the <i>Cirque Parisien</i>
and her appearance in Vienna? Jeanne and
Louise could come up to Paris for Christmas
and the New Year, and be present at the
ceremony. By that time he would have his
affairs arranged so that he could go with her
to Vienna.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, they must dismiss Pelletier after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
their marriage. Jules would take charge of
his wife's affairs; his capacity for business
would enable him to make good terms for
her. He would plan wonderful tours; he
would write to America, perhaps, and secure
engagements for her there; artists were wonderfully
well paid in America, better than in
any other country, and they would enjoy
seeing the new world together.</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche listened to his talk with a touching
confidence; she seemed to think it natural
that he should speak as if he had authority
over her. She made no protest against any
of his suggestions, though she repeated that
nothing could be decided till her mother
returned to Paris.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we'll write to your mother,&quot; said
Jules. &quot;We'll write to her this very day&mdash;this
afternoon when we go back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment her face clouded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's the matter? Don't you want
me to write to your mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not reply at once. When she did
speak, she kept her eyes fixed on her plate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be so hard to be separated from
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
Jules laughed, and bent toward her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you can't stay with her always,&quot; he
said tenderly. &quot;Then we'll take Madeleine
with us. That will be a capital plan. She's
strong and healthy, though she's over sixty,
and she won't mind the travelling. Besides,
we shall be in Vienna three months, and
we'll rent a little apartment. It will be like
being at home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke as if their future were settled,
and his tone of confidence seemed to reassure
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to have Madeleine,&quot; she
said simply. &quot;She is so good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On their return to the apartment, they
devoted themselves to writing long letters to
Madame Perrault. Jules' letter was full of
rhapsodies, of promises to be kind to the
girl who had consented to be his wife, and
of his plans for the future. They read their
letters to each other, or rather Jules read
all of his, and Blanche read part of hers,
firmly refusing to allow him to hear the rest.
They spent a very happy afternoon together,
and in the evening Madeleine had a sumptuous
dinner for them, with an enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
bunch of fresh roses on the table. In the
evening they went to the <i>Comédie Française</i>,
to finish what Jules declared to be the happiest
day of his life.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules counted that day as the beginning of
his real career. He looked back on himself
during the years he had lived before it almost
with pity. Since leaving the <i>lycée</i>, he had
been merely a drudge, a piece of mechanism
in the odious machinery of business. He
had been content enough, but with the contentment
of ignorance. How lonely and
sordid his existence out of the office had
been! He thought of his solitary dinners
in <i>cafés</i>, surrounded by wretched beings like
himself deprived of the happiness that comes
from home and from an honest love. To
the twins and his other comrades at the
office he said nothing of the change that had
taken place in his life; he was afraid they
would chaff him; of course, when they heard
he was going to marry an acrobat, they would
make foolish jokes and treat him with a
familiar levity. He determined not to tell
them of his marriage until the eve of his
departure from business; he would have to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
give the firm at least a fortnight's notice;
but he would merely explain to Monsieur
Mercier that he intended to devote a few
months to travel, and thought of going to
America.</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault replied at once to Jules'
letter. She made no pretence of being surprised
by the news it contained; and she
expressed her pleasure at the engagement,
and gave her consent. But they must not
make any definite plans until her return to
Paris. That would be in about two weeks,
for Aunt Sophie was very much better now
and rapidly gaining strength, though she had
as yet been unable to leave her bed. As
soon as Sophie could go out, she was to be
carried to the house of her cousin, Angélique
Magnard, who would give her the best of
care. Then Madame Perrault would be able
to take Jeanne and Louise to Paris for the
holidays; the girls were wild to see their dear
Blanche again and to meet Jules. Monsieur
Berthier talked of coming with them; he,
too, was eager to make the acquaintance of
Blanche's future husband.</p>

<p class="indent">After these preliminaries, Madame Perrault
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
devoted herself to practical matters.
She felt it her duty to inform Monsieur Jules
that Blanche had no <i>dot</i>; she had earned
a great deal of money, but most of it had
been spent in maintaining the family; since
the death of her father she had been their
sole support. Of course, after marriage,
her daughter's earnings would belong to
Jules; but he must distinctly understand
that he was taking a penniless bride. After
her own marriage, Madame Perrault would
have no fear for the future; Monsieur Berthier
had promised of his own accord to
provide for the girls; indeed, it was chiefly
for their sake that, at the age of fifty-three,
she was willing to marry again. So Blanche
would no longer have her family dependent
on her.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules replied with an impassioned letter.
He didn't care whether Blanche had a <i>dot</i>
or not. He wanted to marry her because
he loved her, because without her his life
would be unendurable: he would marry her
if she were the poorest girl in France. It
took him several pages to say this, and he
read the letter with satisfaction, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
aloud to Blanche, who laughed over it, and
gave him a timid little kiss in acknowledgment
of his devotion. He thought he had
done a commendable act, and he felt convinced
that every word he had written was
true.</p>

<p class="indent">At the office Jules grew reserved, and he
resented haughtily the familiarities of the
twins. Indeed, to all of his companions
in the wool-house he could not help displaying
the superiority he felt. He would be
there only a few weeks longer, and he acted
as if he were conferring a favor on his employer
by staying. The twins spent many
hours in discussing the change in him; but
they could not discover the cause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to have heard him talk to
old Mercier the other day,&quot; said Leroux.
&quot;You'd think he was the President receiving
a deputation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Early in November, Blanche received a
letter from her mother, saying Aunt Sophie
was so much better that they had decided
to move her the next day, and two days
later she would herself leave Boulogne with
the girls and Monsieur Berthier. Jules was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
both glad and sorry to hear the news,&mdash;sorry
because his long <i>tête-à-têtes</i> with Blanche
would end for a time, and glad because he
would be able to arrange definitely with
her mother for the marriage. Madeleine
grieved at parting with the girl, but was consoled
when Jules explained that she would
probably be needed every night at the circus
after Madame Perrault's return, for, of course,
Monsieur Berthier would want to take his
<i>fiancée</i> to the theatres. In speaking of
Monsieur Berthier, Jules had adopted a
facetious tone, which half-amused and half-pained
Blanche.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How droll it will be,&quot; he said one day,
&quot;to have two pairs of lovers billing and cooing
together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mamma doesn't bill and coo,&quot; the girl
replied, with just a suggestion of resentment
in her tone. &quot;She's too sensible.&quot; Then
Jules patted her affectionately on the cheek,
and told her she mustn't take what he said
so seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monsieur Berthier must be a very good
man, or he wouldn't get such a good wife,&quot;
he said lightly. Then, with a comic look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
in his eyes, he added as an afterthought:
&quot;What a very good person I must be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The next night, when Jules appeared in
the <i>rue St. Honoré</i> for dinner, he found the
little apartment crowded. Madame Perrault
embraced him, and by addressing him as
&quot;my son,&quot; seemed to receive him formally
into the family. Then she introduced the
two girls, who were much larger than he
had imagined them to be. Jeanne, rosy-cheeked
and black-eyed, approached him
fearlessly, and offered her hand with a smile;
Louise, fair and slight, with her light brown
hair braided down her back, looked frightened,
and blushed furiously when she received
her salutation. The little fat man
standing in front of the mantel, Jules recognized
at once from his pointed white beard
and laughing eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should have known you in a crowd
on the <i>Boulevard</i>,&quot; Jules said, as he extended
his hand. &quot;You're exactly like
your photograph.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you are even better-looking than
Mathilde said you were,&quot; Monsieur Berthier
replied. &quot;Ah, little one,&quot; he went on,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
turning to Blanche, and giving her a pinch
on the arm, &quot;you're getting a fine, handsome
husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules tried to make friends with the girls.
With Jeanne he had no difficulty; she was
quite ready to banter with him, and he found
her pert and quick-witted. Louise, however,
was so shy that he could extract only monosyllables
from her. She seemed to him very
like Blanche, only less pretty. Jeanne had
Blanche's beauty, more highly-colored and
exuberant; her snapping black eyes showed,
too, that she had a will and a temper of
her own. Jules began to chaff her, to make
her show her spirit, but she parried his jests
good-humoredly, and she retaliated very
smartly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't see how you ever dared to fall
in love with Blanche,&quot; she said. &quot;Aren't
you afraid of her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afraid of her?&quot; Jules laughed. &quot;Why
should I be afraid of her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don't know. I suppose because
she's so good. I'm afraid of her sometimes.
And I'm afraid of Louise when she gets her
pious look on. How did you happen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
fall in love with her? Do tell me. I'll
never tell in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I just saw her, that's all,&quot; Jules explained
with mock gravity. &quot;Isn't that
enough?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the circus?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you fell in love with her because
she does such wonderful things, and looks
so beautiful in the ring. Now, you wouldn't
have fallen in love if you'd just met her like
any one else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it was because she wasn't like anyone
else that I did fall in love with her,&quot;
Jules insisted, with the air of carrying on
the joke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if she'd never been in the circus&mdash;if
you'd just met her here, or anywhere else
except in the circus&mdash;do you think you
would have fallen in love with her then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I should,&quot; Jules replied unhesitatingly,
though he knew he was lying.</p>

<p class="indent">Jeanne shrugged her shoulders and looked
skeptical.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I could be in the circus,&quot; she
said, &quot;and get flowers, and be admired, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
earn a lot of money like Blanche. And
isn't it the funniest thing,&quot; she went on,
growing more confidential, &quot;Blanche doesn't
care about it at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;About the flowers, and being admired,
and all that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. And she says the circus isn't a
good place for a young girl. But I say if
it's good enough for her, it's good enough
for me. Anyway, if mamma doesn't let me
do what Blanche does, I'm going on the
stage when I grow up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules was amused by her talk, and drew her
out by deft questions. While she was animatedly
describing her life in the convent of
Boulogne, where the nuns were always holding
up Louise as a model of good behavior
to her, dinner was announced, and they all
went out into the dining-room, where Jules and
Blanche had passed so many hours together.
This time Jules' place was between Jeanne
and Louise. Jeanne went on with her
chatter, and Louise scarcely spoke, save to
Blanche, with whom she kept exchanging
affectionate smiles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The girls are vexed with me,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
Madame Perrault, &quot;because I won't let
them go to the Circus to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The pale face of Louise brightened with
eagerness and Jeanne turned to her mother
and cried pleadingly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I think it's a shame. The first
time we've been in Paris, too, and we want
to see Blanche perform again so much!
Why can't we go, mamma? Please, please
let us go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, let the children go,&quot; said Monsieur
Berthier good-naturedly. &quot;It would be
cruel to send them to bed early their first
night in Paris.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jules added his voice in the girls'
behalf, but Madame Perrault shook her head
decidedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't have them up so late. Besides,
they need to rest after their journey. If you
are good, Jeanne, and don't tease me to go
to-night, I'll take you and Louise to the
<i>matinée</i> on Saturday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the <i>matinée</i>!&quot; Jeanne pouted, turning
for sympathy to Jules. &quot;Who cares for
the <i>matinée</i>! Isn't it too bad?&quot; she went
on in a low voice, so that her mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
shouldn't hear her. &quot;When I grow up,
Monsieur Jules, I shall go to the theatre
every night&mdash;yes, every night of my life. I
don't care what happens.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jeanne was sullen and Louise looked sad
when they were left alone with Charlotte, the
little maid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won't go to bed till twelve o'clock,&quot;
Jeanne cried, as her mother, with parting
injunctions, went out, followed by the
others. &quot;I shall sit up and cry all the
evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nine o'clock, my dear,&quot; said Madame
Perrault serenely. &quot;You know what I said
about Saturday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The door was slammed behind them and,
as they filed downstairs, they heard Jeanne
go stamping back into the <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you think you're severe with the
child, Mathilde?&quot; said Berthier.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Félix, not too severe, if you mean
that. It's the only way to keep her in
check. She has too much spirit. I'm afraid
of it sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's just the way you used to be at
her age,&quot; he laughed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
&quot;And that's just why I mean to keep her
down,&quot; she replied, almost sternly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jeanne has all the spirit of the family,&quot;
said Berthier, glancing at Jules.</p>

<p class="indent">After the performance they returned to the
apartment for supper. Jules was surprised to
find the table steaming with hot dishes, bright
with flowers and with wine-glasses. Madeleine,
who seemed to be in the secret, put on
an apron, and proceeded to assist Charlotte.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We've prepared a little feast for you,&quot;
Madame Perrault explained, &quot;in honour of
Blanche's engagement. Félix has provided
the champagne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Berthier rubbed his hands and smiled,
and they took their places at the table.
They were all hungry and in good spirits.
This was the happiest time of the day for
Blanche; though she never consciously
worried about her work, she always felt
relieved when her performance was done,
and she was free to go home and rest. The
little rosy-cheeked Charlotte busied herself
around them, passing dishes and bringing
on fresh ones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a shame to keep this poor child up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
so late,&quot; said Berthier, when she had left the
room for a moment. &quot;Why not send her
to bed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll send her as soon as she brings in the
rest of the things,&quot; Madame Perrault replied.
&quot;She and Madeleine can have something to
eat together. I sha'n't have to send Madeleine
home with you to-night, Jules. We've
made a bed for her in Charlotte's room.
She's a good creature, your Madeleine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Charlotte came in with the rest of the
dishes, and Madame Perrault told her to eat
something, and go to bed. &quot;And tell Madeleine
not to wait up for us. You can clear
the things away in the morning. Did Jeanne
go to bed at nine o'clock, Charlotte?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, madame.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And without any trouble?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, madame.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did she do to amuse herself during
the evening?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Charlotte's cheeks took on a deeper red.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She tried to imitate Mademoiselle
Blanche in the circus,&quot; she confessed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that accounts for the broken chair!
Good night, Charlotte.&quot; Then, as the girl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
left the room, Madame Perrault sighed.
&quot;That Jeanne will be the death of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll take her in hand when she comes
to me,&quot; Berthier laughed. &quot;We'll have to
find a husband for her. That will cure her
of her craze for the circus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A husband for Jeanne, little Jeanne!&quot;
Madame Perrault exclaimed in horror.
&quot;She's barely fourteen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And in two years she'll be a woman.
I was in love with you at fifteen. Don't you
remember? We thought of eloping.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Taisez-vous!</i>&quot; cried Madame Perrault,
flushing, and trying not to join in the laughter
that the speech excited from Jules. &quot;You
make me a great fool before my daughter and
my new son.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He isn't your son yet,&quot; Berthier insisted,
to tease her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he will be soon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's just what I wanted you to say!&quot;
Jules cried. &quot;The sooner the better. Tomorrow
would suit me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The glasses had been filled with champagne,
and Berthier lifted his glass high in
the air, crying:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
&quot;Let us drink to the <i>fiancés</i>! May their
marriage be long and their engagement short!
Here's health and happiness to them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They all stood up smiling and drank
together. Then as they sat down again,
Berthier went on:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, I know the folly of long engagements.
Get married, get married, my children,
as soon as you can, while love is young.
I once knew a young girl&mdash;as beautiful as
the morning&mdash;more beautiful, a thousand
times more beautiful. Well, this young girl
loved a handsome, yes, I may say a fairly
handsome, at any rate, an honest young fellow,
who fairly worshipped her in return. But the
stern parents of this beautiful young girl&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Taisez-vous!</i>&quot; Madame Perrault repeated.
&quot;No more nonsense. If your beautiful
young girl hadn't obeyed her parents,
where would Blanche Perrault be at this moment,
I should like to know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, my friend,&quot; said Berthier to Jules,
&quot;it's the women who forget. Only the men
are constant in this world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault rolled her eyes in mock
horror.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
&quot;Constant&mdash;the men!&quot; she repeated
scornfully. &quot;They don't know what constancy
is. If it weren't for the constant
women in the world, the men would go
straight to the devil.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Berthier burst into hilarious laughter. He
loved nothing better than to be vanquished
in an argument by Madame Perrault. Indeed,
he often argued simply in order to
provoke her. He gave Jules a quick glance
and a nod which plainly said: &quot;Isn't she a
fine woman? Have you ever seen a woman
so clever?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The innocent pleasantries of the old lovers,
however, were lost on Jules. He wanted to
discuss in all seriousness his forthcoming
marriage, and this was certainly a suitable
occasion. So he determined to put the conversation
on another basis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sure Monsieur Berthier is right
about long engagements,&quot; he said, &quot;and
there's no reason why our engagement
shouldn't be short. I love Blanche, and
Blanche loves me, and we think we can
make each other happy. I can afford to
marry&mdash;I have a little property&mdash;and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
she marries me Blanche will have a protector
in her professional career.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bravo!&quot; cried Berthier. &quot;That was
said like a man!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the sooner I'm married, the better
for you,&quot; Jules went on, fixing his eyes on
Berthier's white beard. &quot;Then Madame
Perrault won't be tied down to Blanche, and
there's no reason why you shouldn't be
married, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We might have a double marriage!&quot;
said the little man jocosely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, <i>no</i>!&quot; Madame exclaimed.
&quot;When I'm married I shall be married
very quietly in Boulogne, without any fuss.
These children shall be married first. Then
some day, Félix, you and I shall walk to the
church and it will be over in five minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Berthier breathed a long sigh, and laid
his hand gently on Madame Perrault's arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've waited a great many years for those
five minutes, <i>chérie</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blanche's engagement at the Circus ends
the last day of the year,&quot; Jules resumed,
&quot;and she begins her season in Vienna on
the fifteenth of January. Now, there's no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
reason in the world that I can think of to
prevent our being married between the first
of January and the fifteenth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, from every point of view, they discussed
the time of the marriage. Madame
Perrault raised the question of dresses for
the bride, of Jules' inability to arrange his
affairs in so short a time, but these and all
other objections were overruled.</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche herself had very little to say;
when her mother asked her point-blank if
she wanted the marriage to take place so
early, she replied that she was willing if
Jules and the others decided it was best. She
seemed more like a passive spectator than
one actively interested in the discussion;
her eyes kept roving from Jules to her mother,
and from her mother back to Jules. Berthier
supported Jules valiantly, and at two
o'clock, Madame Perrault was finally won
over, and it was decided that the marriage
should take place during the first week in
January. Jules kissed Blanche on the cheek,
and there was general embracing and laughter.
Then the little party broke up, and Monsieur
Berthier followed Jules down the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
&quot;Ah, my boy,&quot; he said, as they stood on
the sidewalk, before saying good-night, &quot;I'd
give all the money I've made for your
youth. Youth is the time for love. In my
youth it came to me, but I lost it. Take
good care of it, my friend,&quot; he concluded,
tapping Jules' hand affectionately as they
were about to go their separate ways.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span></p>

<h2>X</h2>

<p class="indent">Jules at once began preparations for
his marriage. He gave notice of his
intention to leave the wool-house, and to
move from his apartment. Monsieur Mercier
showed no regret at his departure.
&quot;I've observed that you were no longer
interested in your work,&quot; he said coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules turned away with a sense of disappointment
and pain, feeling that he had been
badly treated. Though he said nothing to
the twins about his going, they speedily
heard of it and gibed him for the reason.
He preferred to maintain an air of mystery,
but one morning Leroux came into the office,
shaking a copy of the <i>Triomphe</i> in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me congratulate you!&quot; he cried, extending
his hand. &quot;I respect a man that
can make a stroke like that. I've known
you were up to some game all along,&quot; he
added insinuatingly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
Jules looked at the paper, and in the column
devoted to news of the theatre he read of the
engagement of Mademoiselle Blanche, of the
<i>Cirque Parisien</i>, to Monsieur Jules Le Baron,
a young business man of wealth. Dufresne
added his congratulations, and one after another
during the day Jules' other comrades
came up to shake his hand. No wonder he
had been putting on airs with them! They
treated him very jocosely, however, teased
him about his reputed wealth, and tortured
him with their coarse jokes, so that he looked
forward with relief to escaping from them.</p>

<p class="indent">All of Jules' leisure was passed with
Blanche and her family. He made friends
with the girls and with Monsieur Berthier.
The better acquainted he became with
Louise the more he liked her; Jeanne
sometimes vexed him by making fun of
him, though he was careful not to betray
his annoyance. For Monsieur Berthier he
felt a genuine esteem; the little man was
always in good humor, though Jules suspected
that, in spite of his success in business,
his whole life had been clouded by the disappointment
of his youth. As for Madame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
Perrault, notwithstanding the apparent lightness
of her character, which had at first
prejudiced him against her, the effective
way in which she managed her affairs made
him realize that she was a woman to be
respected. Sometimes Jules wondered what
kind of man Blanche's father had been; he
fancied that of the two the mother had been
by far the stronger.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules passed Christmas with his friends
and spent a month's salary on gifts for
Blanche and her sisters. For the girls
Madame had a <i>fête</i> in the morning after
mass, with a Christmas tree laden with
presents, and decorated with candles and
trinkets and <i>bonbons</i>. She chose this time
of day, as both in the afternoon and evening
Blanche gave performances.</p>

<p class="indent">The next morning Madame Perrault
learned through Pelletier that the circus in
Vienna where Blanche had been engaged
to appear was a little more than ninety
feet high; so the plunge would be fifteen
feet deeper than it was in Paris. This news
created excitement in the family. It made
Madame so nervous that she urged that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
engagement be given up and an offer that
had come from Nice be accepted; but Jules
laughed at the idea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's a difference of fifteen feet to
Blanche?&quot; he said. &quot;It's just as easy for
her to dive ninety feet as to dive seventy-five.
The only thing for Blanche to do is
to go to Vienna as soon as her engagement
here is over. Then she can practise the
plunge every morning for two weeks. We'll
simply have to get married a little earlier
than we intended.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Perrault saw the force of the
argument, and Monsieur Berthier seconded
Jules. As for Blanche, she declared that
she should not be afraid of the plunge; at
Bucharest she had made a plunge of nearly
eighty-three feet. So it was agreed that the
civil marriage should take place very quietly
on the third of January, and the religious ceremony
the day after. Jules and his bride
could leave Paris by the afternoon train,
accompanied by Madeleine. Madame Perrault
was anxious to keep any notice out of
the papers, if possible; she thought it might
injure Blanche professionally. She had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
greatly vexed by the paragraph in the <i>Triomphe</i>
and had attributed it to Durand; but
Jules explained that the <i>Triomphe</i> was not
Durand's paper; besides, the journalist had
been sent for the winter to the Riviera as
correspondent.</p>

<p class="indent">On the last day of the year Jules bade
farewell to his associates at the wool-house.
Most of them regretted his departure, for
before his sudden accession of dignity he
had been well liked among them. The next
morning, on the first day of his emancipation,
when he went to the apartment in the <i>rue
St. Honoré</i>, he found some pieces of silver
there, the gift of his old comrades. He knew
at once that the twins had started a subscription
for him, and he felt ashamed of his treatment
of them during his last weeks among
them. He soon forgot about them, however,
and was absorbed in the preparations for his
new life. He had sold most of his furniture,
save a few pieces that were so intimately
associated with the memory of his mother
that he could not part with them.</p>

<p class="indent">For Madeleine this was a trying time; she
performed her numerous duties, involving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
several journeys to the <i>rue St. Honoré</i>, with
a look of bewilderment in her face, as if she
could not adjust herself to the change that
was about to take place in her life.</p>

<p class="indent">Two days before the time chosen for their
civil marriage, Jules was sitting alone with
Blanche, beside the fireplace where he had
passed most of his courtship. They had
been making plans for Vienna, and Jules
felt as if he were already at the head of a
household.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know,&quot; he said, glancing at
the engagement ring on her left hand that
sparkled in the firelight, &quot;I haven't been
able to make up my mind yet what to give
you for a wedding present. I wish you'd
tell me what you'd like. I want to give
you something that will please you very
much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked intently into the fireplace, and
did not reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn't there something that you want especially?&quot;
Then Jules saw her face flush,
and he went on quickly: &quot;Ah, I know there
is, but you're afraid to tell. Now, out with
it. Is it a diamond brooch, or one of those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
queer little gold watches that women carry,
set with jewels, or one of those bracelets
that we saw in the shop in the <i>rue de la Paix</i>
the other day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She began to laugh, and without turning
her eyes toward him, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know I don't care for those things.
But there&mdash;there is something&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, out with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn't a&mdash;it isn't what you think&mdash;a
present or anything like that; but it is something
I should like to have you&mdash;something
that would make me very happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then tell me what it is,&quot; said Jules, impatiently.
&quot;What are you afraid of? Am I
such an ogre?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment she did not answer. Then
she said timidly: &quot;I wish you'd go to confession
before we're married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He burst into a laugh that rang through
the apartment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, is that all? So you're afraid to
marry such a wicked person as I am till the
Church has forgiven him and made him good
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
&quot;No, it isn't that, Jules. I don't believe
you are wicked. I don't believe you ever
were; but I should be so much happier if
you would go to confession, and then before
we're married in church we could go to
communion together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He threw himself beside her chair, seized
her head in his hands, and kissed her on the
forehead. &quot;I'm not fit to be your husband.
You're too good for me,&quot; he said softly.</p>

<p class="indent">She drew away from him with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And will it make you very much happier
if I go to confession?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Jules, very much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For an instant he hesitated, looking into
her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I'll go,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned to him, and threw her arms
around his neck. As he held her closely
to him, his lips pressed against her hair,
he went on:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it will be hard for me, Blanche. I
haven't been to confession for more than
twelve years. Think of all the things I shall
have to tell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be over in a few minutes,&quot; she said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
reassuringly. &quot;Then you'll be glad you've
done it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He rose to his feet and drew his chair
nearer hers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've even forgotten how to make a confession.
I don't even remember the <i>Confiteor</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall have to teach it to you.
It's in my prayer-book, and you can take it
and learn it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I sha'n't know what to do. I shall
appear awkward and foolish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's easy enough. You begin by examining
your conscience; then you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Examining my conscience! I shall have
to wake it up first. It's been sound asleep
all these years. Ah, my dear Blanche, you
can't imagine how pleasant it is to have your
conscience asleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She ignored his jesting, and went on:
&quot;Then you have to be sorry for what you've
done,&mdash;for the sins, I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if you're not sorry. They've been
very pleasant, a good many of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, if you aren't sorry you can't
go to confession. That's what people go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
for, because they <i>are</i> sorry, and because they
intend to try to be better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But all the confessions in the world
wouldn't make me better. It's only you
that can do that. I'm sorry for my sins
simply because, when I think of them, they
take me so far away from you. If I hadn't
met you, I shouldn't have thought they
were so bad. But when I think of you,
Blanche, and when I look at you, you seem
so good&mdash;well, I&mdash;I feel ashamed, and
then I want to be good too. Why can't
I confess to you?&quot; he went on banteringly.
&quot;You'd do me more good than all the
priests in Christendom. Only I'm afraid
I should shock you. I suppose the priests
hear stories like mine every day; so one
or two more or less wouldn't make any
difference to them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned her head away, and he saw
that he had offended her. So he patted her
cheek and smiled into her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a little <i>dévote</i> she is, anyway!
She's vexed even when I joke about her
religion. Don't you see that it's all fun,
dear? I'm going to do everything you say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
make a clean breast of it to the priest, tell
him I'm sorry, and promise to be good for the
rest of my life. It won't be hard to promise
that. How can I help being good when I
shall have you with me all the time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then for an hour they talked seriously
about the confession. The more he thought
of the ordeal, the more nervous Jules felt.
Sins came back to him, committed during
those first few years after he left the <i>lycée</i>,
when his freedom was novel and delicious.
How could he tell of those things, how could
he put them into the awful baldness of
speech? He knew that no sin could be
concealed in the confessional; but he asked
Blanche if he would have to be particular,
if he couldn't say in a general way that he
had broken this commandment or that.
He was alarmed by her reply that she told
everything, that sometimes the priest asked
probing questions. He couldn't endure the
shame of speaking out those horrors. He
was afraid, however, to acknowledge his
fears to the girl; they might make her suspect
what he had done, and inspire her with
a loathing for him.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
Jules had heard that some men told the
women they were going to marry of their
lapses, and he had been greatly amused.
It never occurred to him that he ought to
reveal the dark passages in his life to
Blanche; these would simply shock her,
give her wrong ideas about him, perhaps
make her suspicious and jealous after marriage.
His sins he had always regarded as
follies of youth: they did not in any way
affect his character or his honor as a gentleman.
Now, however, he was looking back
on himself, not from the point of view of the
man of the world, but of a good woman.</p>

<p class="indent">That night, on leaving Blanche at the
theatre, instead of roaming in the <i>Boulevards</i>,
or reading the papers in the <i>cafés</i>, as he
had of late been doing till half-past ten,
he took a <i>fiacre</i> to the Madeleine, where
he spent one of the most disagreeable hours
of his life. Vespers were being sung, and
the church was nearly full; he sought an
obscure corner, knelt there before a picture
of Christ carrying the Cross of Calvary, repeated
an &quot;Our Father,&quot; and a &quot;Hail Mary,&quot;
which came back to him like an echo of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
his mother's voice, and then gave himself
up to the task of examining his conscience.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole panorama of his manhood
passed before him, the life of the young
Parisian at the close of the century,&mdash;selfish,
cynical, pleasure-loving, sense-gratifying,
animal. He buried his face in his hands.
Oh, what an existence! Yet he dared to
take a pure young girl for his wife, to make
her the mother of his children! He could
not think of himself or of his sins without
reference to her, and the more he thought
of her and of them, the deeper his shame
became, and this shame he mistook for contrition.
This then was what Blanche had
meant by saying that he must be sorry for
what he had done, and must promise to fight
against temptation. From the depth of his
heart he believed he was sorry.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he took from his pocket the prayer-book
that she had given him, and read
several times the act of contrition and the
<i>Confiteor</i>. The repetition recalled them to
his memory, and he was ready for his confession
to the priest the next day. With
a sigh he rose from his seat, feeling as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
he had thrown off the burden of his past
life and received a benediction.</p>

<p class="indent">The next afternoon, when Jules entered
with Blanche the church of <i>St. Philippe de
Roule</i>, he found groups of people kneeling
around the confessional boxes and in front
of the altars. He had resolved to confess to
Father Labiche, who, Blanche had told him,
was the most lenient of all the fathers. The
names of the priests were printed on the
boxes, and the largest crowd was gathered
around the box assigned to Jules' choice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid you'll have to wait a long
time,&quot; Blanche whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind,&quot; Jules replied nervously.</p>

<p class="indent">He felt almost glad that he was to have
a respite. The sight of the confessional
boxes and of the people whispering prayers,
together with the atmosphere of devotion
that pervaded the place, had filled him with
terror. Blanche made a sign to him to go
forward and join the group awaiting Father
Labiche, and she herself stopped near the
group beside it, knelt and made the sign of
the cross. Jules, too, knelt before one of the
hard-wood benches, and prayed that he might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
have the courage and grace to make a good
confession. Then he went over again the
sins that he had to confess, and he repeated
the <i>Confiteor</i> and the act of contrition.</p>

<p class="indent">All day long these prayers, and the items
of his confession, had been surging in his
mind, and now, as he sat up and waited for
his turn to come in the procession that
passed in and out on either side of the confessional,
they kept repeating themselves.
He looked at the wrinkled women around
him, and wondered if their feelings were
like his; he could see no nervousness, no
fear in their faces; they seemed to be
absorbed, almost exalted in their devotion.
Then he began to grow impatient, and
wished that the people who entered the confessional
would not take so much time. He
could catch glimpses of the dark figure of
the priest, bending his head from one side
to the other, and glancing out at the people.
In his line at least fifteen persons were
waiting their turn before him; it would
take Father Labiche more than two hours,
Jules feared, to hear them and the fifteen
others in the opposite line. His thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
turned to Blanche, and he wondered if she
had been heard yet. He looked around,
and saw her in the crowd behind him, reading
her prayer-book; she kept apart from
the others, and had evidently finished her
confession and was waiting for him.</p>

<p class="indent">How gentle and good she looked; how
different from her appearance in the ring!
Once again he saw her tumbling through
the air in her silk tights. He tried to drive
this thought from his mind, but again and
again he saw her, climbing hand over hand
to the top of the Circus, hurling herself backward,
spinning through the air, striking the
padded net with a thud, bouncing up again,
and landing, with the pretty gesture of both
hands, on her feet. And in two days she
would be his wife! They would go away
together, and whenever she performed in
public, he would appear with her, hold the
rope while she climbed to the top of the
building, make the dramatic announcement
that would awe the audience into silence,
and then scamper across the net to the platform
before she fell.</p>

<p class="indent">For more than an hour Jules thought of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
this brilliant future; then he suddenly realized
where he was, and he saw that he had
moved up within three places of the confessional.
In a few moments it would be his
turn to go into that dark box, where so
many ghastly secrets were told, where he
would be obliged to reveal all the vileness
and the weakness of his human nature. His
nerves vibrated; he felt as if something
within him were sinking, as if his courage
were leaving him. Then his lips began
again to repeat the <i>Confiteor</i>, and his mind
ran nervously over his self-accusations.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman before him remained so long
in the confessional that he wondered if she
would ever come out; but when she did
appear he had a sudden access of terror.
He rose mechanically, however, made his
way into the box, and knelt beside the
little closed slide, through which the priest
conferred with the penitents. He could
hear the low murmur of Father Labiche's
voice, and the more faint responses of a
woman confessing on the other side. He
tried not to listen, but he could not help
catching a few words. Suddenly the slide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
was opened, and he confronted the kindly
face of the old priest whose right hand
was raised in blessing.</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche had seen Jules enter the confessional,
and she waited for him to appear
again. The woman who had entered before
him on the other side soon came out; so
Jules was now making his peace with God.
She lowered her head, and breathed a
simple prayer of thankfulness. Ten, fifteen
minutes passed; still he did not come.
She wondered why Father Labiche kept him
there so long. When at last he did appear,
his face was white. Poor Jules! she thought.
How hard it must have been for him, and
how good he was to have gone through it
so heroically. He walked forward to the
main altar, and there he knelt for several
moments. When he came back, he found
her waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; he said, touching her on the
arm.</p>

<p class="indent">They did not speak till they were in the
street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was pretty tough,&quot; he said doggedly.
&quot;I thought he'd never let me out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
She smiled up into his face. &quot;But it's
all over now, Jules.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it's all over,&quot; he repeated grimly.
&quot;But I should hate to go through it again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They hurried on through the nipping
January air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid we shall be late for dinner,
Jules. It must be after half-past six, and
then we have so many things to do to-night.
My trunks aren't all packed yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would help you if I could,&quot; Jules
replied, &quot;but I must go back to the church.
Father Labiche gave me the Stations of
the Cross for penance. He said he thought
it would do me good before I was married to
reflect on the sufferings of Christ,&quot; he explained
with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you told him you were going to be
married?&quot; she laughed, her breath steaming
in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He asked how I happened to come to
confession after staying away so long; so
I had to acknowledge that I did it to please
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little apartment was in commotion
over Blanche's marriage and departure two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
days later; the <i>petit salon</i> was littered with
dresses, and the two girls were greatly
excited over their new frocks. Jules saw
that he was in the way, and soon after
dinner he left his friends, saying that he
would have the carriages ready for them at
half-past seven in the morning; Blanche,
her mother, and Monsieur Berthier would
ride with him in one, and in the other the
girls would go with Madeleine and Pelletier,
who had been invited on account of his long
business association with the family.</p>

<p class="indent">That night at church Jules did his best to
put himself into a religious frame of mind
and to feel a proper pity for the sufferings of
Christ. As he passed from station to station
in the Way of the Cross, he reflected seriously
on the significance of each, and he said
his prayers devoutly. But his mind was
constantly distracted by the thought of the
girl he loved and of his marriage the next
day. At the most inopportune moments
visions of Blanche would haunt him as she
looked in the ring, climbing the rope and
whirling through the air.</p>

<p class="indent">When his prayers were said he felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
radiantly happy. He had done his duty,
and he felt that he deserved to be rewarded.
It was only nine o'clock, but he hurried
home at once to go on with his packing.
When he went to bed that night, he dreamed
that he was making his first appearance in
the circus at Vienna, holding the rope for
his wife, and speaking the thrilling words of
warning to the audience.</p>

<p class="indent">In the morning Jules and Blanche received
communion at early mass, and later they
went with Madame Perrault and Monsieur
Berthier to the Mayor's office, where the
civil marriage ceremony was performed.
This Jules regarded merely as a formality,
though it made him feel that she was at
last his, his forever! No one could take
her away from him now! The next morning
was clear and cold, and the sun shone as he
looked out of his window in the dismantled
apartment. He smiled as he thought that
his lonely days as a bachelor were over. At
ten o'clock he drove to the <i>rue St. Honoré</i>
with Madeleine, who looked a dozen years
younger in her simple black silk with a piece
of white lace at her throat, the gift of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
Madame Perrault. Blanche, in her white
satin dress with the bunch of white roses
he had sent to her in her hand, had never
seemed to him so beautiful. It was after
eleven o'clock when they reached <i>St. Philippe</i>,
and a crowd of idlers hung about the door
and followed them into the church.</p>

<p class="indent">To Jules the mass that preceded the
marriage ceremony seemed interminable;
he kept glancing at Blanche's flushed face
and downcast eyes, and plucking at his
gloves. Then, when he found himself standing
before the priest, holding Blanche's
hand, and listening to the solemn words of
the service, he came near bursting into tears.
He thought afterward how ridiculous he
would have been if he hadn't been able to
control himself. He was relieved when the
service was ended, and as he walked to the
vestry with his wife on his arm, he could
have laughed aloud for joy.</p>

<p class="indent">When the register had been signed and
they had shaken hands with the priest, they
drove at once to the <i>café</i> in the <i>avenue de
l'Opéra</i>, where Jules had ordered a sumptuous
breakfast. There they remained till four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
o'clock. Monsieur Berthier was the gayest
of them all, and he was seconded by Jeanne,
who pretended to flirt desperately with Jules
and made pert speeches to Pelletier. Then
they all returned to the <i>rue St. Honoré</i>, where
Blanche changed her wedding finery for a
travelling dress.</p>

<p class="indent">During the farewell between Blanche and
her family, Jules suffered; he never could
bear the sight of women in tears. He was
greatly relieved when he put his almost
hysterical wife and Madeleine into the carriage,
and slammed the door behind him.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span></p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p class="indent">They went straight to Vienna, arriving
fatigued from their long journey.
After three days, spent at a little French
hotel, Jules found near the <i>Ringstrasse</i> a furnished
apartment that suited him, and they
took possession at the end of the week.</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche soon felt at home, but Madeleine,
though she had become deeply attached to
her new mistress, and now had more companionship
than she had known since the
death of Jules' mother, secretly grieved for
her beloved Paris, and looked and acted as
if utterly bewildered.</p>

<p class="indent">The day of his arrival in Vienna, Jules
proceeded to the Circus and had a long talk
with Herr Prevost, the manager, with regard
to his wife's engagement. He explained the
difference in the plunge Blanche would be
obliged to take there from her usual one,
and persuaded Prevost to make this a feature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
in his advertisements; he also secured permission
for Blanche to practise in the ring
every morning till her engagement began.</p>

<p class="indent">So he went back to the hotel elated, and
explained to Blanche that, after all, in the
theatrical life good management was half the
battle. Now that she had shaken off that
worthless Pelletier and he himself had taken
charge of her affairs, she would undoubtedly
be recognized in a very few years as the
greatest acrobat in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">She must sit at once, in costume, for some
new photographs, and he would send them
to the leading managers of Europe and America.
If they could only arrange to go to
America under good auspices, their fortune
would be made. Instead of receiving, as they
were doing in Vienna, five hundred francs a
week, they would be paid as much as twice
that amount in New York, if not more. Indeed,
Jules had so much to say about America,
he seemed to have it on the brain.</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche experienced no difficulty in making
her plunge in the new amphitheatre, and
after her first trial there, declared that she
had no fear for the public performances.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
Jules, however, insisted on her practising
every morning; she must keep her muscles
limber, he said; besides, if she didn't practise,
she might lose confidence.</p>

<p class="indent">He found himself treating her as her
mother had done, directing her movements
like those of a child, and she obeyed him
as if she considered his attitude toward her
eminently natural and right. Even Madeleine
adopted a motherly tone with her,
chose the dresses she should wear each day,
and instructed her in a thousand feminine
details.</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche, Jules was surprised and secretly
annoyed to discover, could speak German,
and in the mornings she sometimes gave him
lessons. He also picked up a good deal of
German slang in the <i>cafés</i> that he frequented
during the day, where he drank coffee and
read whatever French and English papers he
could find.</p>

<p class="indent">After his wife's performances began, he
found himself falling into a routine of life.
In spite of his distaste for his duties at the
wool-house, he had expected to miss them at
first; but he quickly became accustomed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
his leisure. He really considered himself a
busy person, for in addition to his nightly
appearance in the arena, momentary but intensely
dramatic, he spent considerable time
in fraternizing with the Viennese journalists,
to secure newspaper puffs for his wife,
in conferring with Prevost, and in corresponding
with managers for future engagements.
After his first month in Vienna, he
felt as if he had been connected with the
circus for years.</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche heard constantly from home, from
either her mother or one of the two girls,&mdash;more
often from Louise than from Jeanne,
who hated to write letters. Six weeks after
her departure from Paris, her mother became
Madame Berthier, without, as she had said,
&quot;any fuss,&quot; and was now installed with the
children in the big house where Félix had
passed so many lonely years as a bachelor.
Jules and Blanche wrote a joint letter of congratulation,
and after that Blanche seemed
even happier than she had been; it was so
good, she said, to think that the girls were
provided for.</p>

<p class="indent">In the afternoons Jules took walks or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
drives with his wife, and on Sundays he accompanied
her to early mass in the little
church that they had discovered near their
apartment. Blanche would have liked to go
to high mass, but to this Jules strenuously
objected; it was too long, and he couldn't
understand the sermon, and altogether it
made him sleepy. Sometimes on Sundays
they would go to one of the <i>cafés</i> for <i>déjeuner</i>
or dinner, and over this they used to be very
happy, for it recalled the first months of their
love.</p>

<p class="indent">After a time, however, these walks grew less
frequent. Jules stayed at home more, and
Madeleine became solicitous for Blanche's
health. Jules had long talks with Prevost;
Blanche had been engaged at the Circus for
three months, and Prevost wished to reengage
her for the spring season; but Jules
explained that he had already received several
offers for the spring, and had refused them
all; his wife needed a long rest, and from
Vienna they would go to Boulogne for a few
months, to be with her people.</p>

<p class="indent">The reference to the engagements was not
exactly true; Jules had one offer only for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
summer; that was from Trouville. For the
autumn he had a fairly generous offer from
South America, and a better one from the
Hippodrome in London, to begin on the
first of December. He had practically decided
to accept the offer from London; but
before giving a definite answer, he resolved
to consult Blanche about it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will just fit in with our plans,&quot; he said.
&quot;On the first of May we'll take a good
long rest. We'll go to your mother's old
house. It hasn't been let yet, you know,
and no one will want it before then. So you
and Madeleine and I will live there together,
and we'll pass the days out of doors, and
take long walks by the sea, and forget all
about the circus. Then, when you are well
and strong again, we'll go to London, and
astonish the English, who think there's nothing
good in France. What do you say, dear?
Don't you think that's a good plan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;It will be very
nice, Jules, if&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If? If what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I'm alive,&quot; she answered softly, turning
her head away.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
He took her in his arms and pressed his
cheek against hers. &quot;What a foolish little
girl it is to talk like that! Of course you'll
be alive, and you'll be even better and
stronger and happier than you are now.
And then think of all the good times you'll
have this summer with Jeanne and Louise
and your mother and Monsieur Berthier.
We'll have <i>fêtes</i> for the girls at our house,
and every day we'll go to see your mother.
You don't think she'll be too proud to receive
us, do you, now that she's rich and
important? I suppose she's the queen of
Boulogne, with her carriages and her horses
and her servants. She'll soon be getting
a husband for Jeanne, some fine young
fellow with a lot of money. And won't
Jeanne put him through his paces? She's
a high-stepper, that Jeanne, and I should
pity the man who got her and didn't understand
her. Think of trying to keep
Jeanne down!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In her moments of depression he always
spoke to her like that, and for the time it
cheered her; but when the spring came,
she drooped visibly, and Jules became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
alarmed; sometimes she would have attacks
of convulsive weeping, and these would be
followed by hours of profound sadness, during
which she spoke scarcely a word. There were
other days when she would be full of courage
and hope, gayer than she had ever been;
then they would drive into the country and
she would take deep draughts of the fresh
spring air, and her eyes would brighten and
her cheeks flush.</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of his anxiety, these days were
very happy for Jules; the thought that he
might lose her made her dearer to him.
Sometimes he would take her hand and tell
her that without her he couldn't live; she
had made him realize how wretched his
existence had been before marriage; he
could not go back to that again. Then she
would rest her head on his shoulder and
whisper that she would try to be brave.
Her sufferings seemed to be wholly in her
mind; the doctor Jules consulted said that,
bodily, she was perfectly strong, and could
easily fill her engagement at the circus; her
work in the ring had given her a remarkable
development of the muscles and the chest;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
if she stopped the work now, and ceased to
practise, she would suffer from the inaction.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules, however, felt relieved when the fifteenth
of April came, and they were able to
leave Vienna for Paris. There they remained
only a day, for they were eager to reach
Boulogne and the little home that Madame
Berthier had arranged for them, in the house
where Blanche had been born, and had passed
the few weeks in each year when she was not
travelling.</p>

<p class="indent">When they arrived, early in the afternoon,
Madame Berthier and the girls, together with
Berthier, were at the station to meet them,
and they received a rapturous greeting, the
girls clinging to their sister with frantic embraces.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We had <i>déjeuner</i> prepared for you at
your house,&quot; said Madame, when the first
greetings were over. &quot;I knew you'd want
to go there the first thing. Then to-night
you are to come and dine with us. I feel as
if I hadn't seen you for years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we've never met Madame Berthier
before,&quot; Jules replied, making a feeble attempt
to be gay, for he saw that Blanche's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
meeting with her mother threatened to upset
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Madame blushed like a young girl, and
turning, led the way to the carriages.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One of these is for you and Jules,&quot; she
said. &quot;I don't mean just for now, but for
all the time you are here. Félix chose the
horse for you, dear, and she's so gentle you
can drive her alone if you want to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going to put the three girls and
their mother in the big carriage,&quot; Berthier
said to Jules, &quot;and you and Madeleine and
I will follow them.&quot; The arrival of his stepdaughter
seemed to have given him as much
pleasure as any of the others, and his good-natured
face was radiant. &quot;Jump in, girls,&quot;
he cried, holding out his hand to Blanche.
&quot;We'll have to turn those lilies of yours into
roses this summer, my dear. Here, Jeanne,
stop flirting with Jules, or we won't let you
come with us. You wouldn't have known
our little Louise, Blanche, if you hadn't
expected to find her here, would you?
She's grown an inch in four months. It's
the most wonderful thing I've ever known
in my life. And would you believe it?&mdash;she's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
become a perfect chatterbox&mdash;she's
worse than Jeanne. Sometimes I have to
run out of the room to read my paper in
peace and have a quiet smoke.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The whole family seemed to have agreed
to assume toward Blanche the bantering tone
that Jules had adopted. When they reached
the house they continued their gayety, though
Blanche, tired from her journey, sank weakly
on the couch in the <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked around, however, and saw
that the room had been redecorated, probably
by Monsieur Berthier, and when she
felt rested she went all over the house and
observed many new pieces of furniture, and
many touches here and there that made the
place more attractive and homelike. &quot;Ah,
it is so good to be at home,&quot; she said to
her mother when they were alone; and then
Madame Berthier took her in her arms and
kissed her on the forehead and told her she
must have courage for Jules' sake.</p>

<p class="indent">After the excitement of Paris and Vienna,
Jules found it hard to accustom himself to the
dull life at Boulogne. He bought a small
yacht, and found amusement in sailing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
his new acquaintances, and sometimes, when
the weather was fine, he took Blanche and
the girls with him. He also occupied himself
with the little garden around his cottage;
but this soon bored him, and he gave it
over to Monsieur Berthier's gardener, who
came every few days to look after it. In
the afternoons he drove with Blanche far
into the country, and sometimes they stopped
at a little <i>café</i> by the roadside and had an
early dinner, and then hurried home before
the damp night should close around them.</p>

<p class="indent">On these occasions they had many earnest
talks, and Jules was surprised by the seriousness
and depth of his wife's mind; at any
rate, she impressed him as being wonderfully
profound. The longer he knew her,
the more she awed and puzzled him; there
were moments when she seemed to dwell
in another world, a world that made her
almost a stranger to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Since her return to Boulogne she had grown
much more cheerful than she had been during
those last weeks in Vienna; but a thousand
little things she said showed him that
beneath the surface of her thought there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
still lurked a strange melancholy, an unchangeable
conviction that life was slipping
away from her. He spoke of this once to
her mother, and she explained mysteriously
that he must expect that; it was very natural
with one of Blanche's temperament. She
had known many cases like it before.</p>

<p class="indent">As the summer passed, Jules said little to
his wife about the circus; indeed, her work
was scarcely mentioned between them, though
every morning she practised her exercises.
Jules, however, had decided that they should
go to London late in November and, the
first week of the following month, appear at
the Hippodrome, which had been established
with great success the year before, at a short
distance from the Houses of Parliament.
The contract had not been signed, for Jules
had written to Marshall, the manager, that he
could not bind himself to an engagement
until early in the autumn; but he explained
that his word was as good as any contract.</p>

<p class="indent">When September came, Blanche seemed
much better for her months of rest; her
eyes were brighter, and her cheeks were shot
with color. Sometimes Jules wished that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
she were not quite so religious; she went
to early mass every morning now, and rather
than let her go alone, he went with her, for
Madeleine had assumed the duties of the
household. Their evenings, which during
the summer had been spent chiefly on the
porch of Monsieur Berthier's house, were
now passed in their <i>salon</i>, bright with flowers,
sometimes with a wood-fire crackling on the
old-fashioned hearth. Blanche's fingers were
always busy with soft, fleecy garments, which
Jules used sometimes to take in his hands
and rub affectionately against his face. Then
he often noticed a light in her eyes that he
had never seen before; it reminded him of
pictures of the Madonna. Sometimes he was
so touched when he looked at her that he
would take her in his arms and hold her
close for a long while. Their evenings together
became very dear to him; yet they
said little to each other: he was content to
sit and watch her, with the curtains drawn
to shut out the rest of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally Father Dumény would come
in for an hour's chat. He was a large-framed,
heavy man, with deep gray eyes shaded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
enormous eyebrows that moved up and down
as he spoke. He spoke as he walked, slowly
and lumberingly, and he had a quaint humor
that used to delight Blanche and puzzle Jules.
When he appeared, she always brightened,
and she liked to hear his doleful accounts
of his rheumatism. He seemed to find
humor in everything, even in his arduous
duties and his ailments.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, my children,&quot; he would say, &quot;why
should any one go to the theatre for pleasure?
This life is nothing but a comedy, if you only
look at it in the right way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From Blanche he derived a great deal of
amusement; that she should perform in a
circus always seemed a joke to him, and
he was continually making fun over it. He
had never been at a circus; so, though he
had baptized Blanche and had met her
during her visits in Boulogne, he had never
seen her perform. Once when Jules showed
him a photograph of Blanche as she appeared
while posing on the rope, he rolled
his eyes and pretended to be much shocked,
and they all laughed together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you two people will be leaving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
this nest of yours before winter comes,&quot; he
said one night. &quot;You've made your plans
already, haven't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules looked down at Blanche, but she
avoided his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We haven't decided definitely,&quot; Jules replied,
&quot;but we think of going to London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche sighed, and Father Dumény
glanced at her quickly and then smiled up
at Jules.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She has a notion that she isn't going
to live,&quot; Jules added, nodding at his wife.
&quot;Ridiculous, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Father Dumény put his hands to his
sides, and for a moment his great body
shook with laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I expect to baptize at least half
a dozen of your children! In a few years
we shall see them trotting around here in
Boulogne and coming to my Sunday-school
to be prepared for their first communion.
We need all the good Catholics we can have,
in these days, to fight against the infidelity
that's ruining the country. Ah, my dear
child,&quot; he said, patting Blanche's hand,
&quot;when you're a grandmother with a troop
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
of children around you, you'll look back and
smile at these foolish little fears.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After that night he came oftener, and
kept Blanche laughing with his gayety.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you go to London,&quot; he said one
evening, &quot;I shall give you letters to some
dear English friends of mine,&mdash;Mr. and
Mrs. Tate. I met the Tates when I was
in Paris visiting Father Brémont more than
ten years ago. Mr. Tate represented the
banking-house of Welling Brothers, of London,
there, and now he's in London as a
member of the firm, I believe. You'll like
Mrs. Tate, my dear. She's a good soul, and
she speaks French almost as well as English.
I shall expect to hear that you've become
great friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we aren't sure of going to England
yet,&quot; Blanche replied with a weary smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps we shall go to America,&quot; Jules
laughed. &quot;I want Blanche to see the country.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Toward the end of September Blanche
drooped again, and her mother was with
her nearly every moment of the day, remaining
sometimes till late at night. The girls
had gone back to the convent, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
were allowed to come home twice a week,
and most of their freedom they devoted
to their sister, whom they treated with a
protecting tenderness that used to afford
Jules secret amusement. Madame Berthier
maintained a cheerful composure in her
daughter's presence, but when alone with
Jules she became so serious that for the first
time he grew nervous. Then as his anxiety
deepened he began to resent it, as he did
any long-continued annoyance. Why should
they be kept in idleness and suspense so
long? How stupid to be buried in a wretched
provincial town when they might be earning
thousands of francs in Vienna, or Bucharest,
or Paris!</p>

<p class="indent">Then one night he was suddenly aroused
from his sleep, and he felt a sensation of
mingled horror and awe. He dressed himself
quickly, his whole being wrung by the
groans he heard from the next room, and
tore out of the house to Doctor Brutinière's,
five minutes away. After delivering his
message, he ran breathlessly to summon
Madame Berthier. It took her scarcely
five minutes to dress, and then they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
in the street together. Madame Berthier
went at once to Blanche's room, and Jules
paced up and down in the half-lighted <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">That was the ghastliest night of Jules Le
Baron's life. He was overwhelmed by the
knowledge that Blanche was in agony, that
she was battling for life, that at any moment
he might hear she was dead. Why should
the burden of suffering fall on her? Oh,
how cruel Nature was, how pitiless to women!
The poor child, the poor little one,
to be tortured so! Several times he listened
for a sound, and the silence terrified him.
Suddenly he heard a shriek, loud and piercing,
that only the most exquisite pain could
have wrung, and he clenched his hands in
impotent horror and misery.</p>

<p class="indent">The stillness that followed made him fear
that she was dead, and he could hardly
keep from rushing up the stairs and learning
the truth. After a few moments, as he
stood at the door, he heard another cry,
small, timorous, peevish, that changed to a
wail and then died away. He turned into
the room, clapsed his face in his hands,
and cried, &quot;Thank God, thank God! And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
mercy for her, my God, mercy for my poor
little Blanche!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After what seemed to him a long time,
during which he was tortured with suspense,
a door opened and shut, and he heard a
rustling on the stairs. He stepped out into
the hall and saw Madame Berthier descending.
She stopped, smiled, and put her hand
to her lips; he could see traces of tears
in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come up,&quot; she whispered. &quot;It's all
over. It's a girl, and Blanche has her in
her arms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules bounded up the stairs. &quot;Only a
minute, you know,&quot; she said softly, &quot;and
you must be very quiet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When she opened the door he almost
pushed her aside in his eagerness to enter.
The Doctor and Madeleine were standing
beside the bed, where Blanche, white but
bright-eyed and smiling, was lying with the
babe nestling close to her. Jules flung himself
by her side, and kissed her passionately,
murmuring incoherent words of love and
thankfulness.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span></p>

<h2>XII</h2>

<p class="indent">The weeks of convalescence that followed
were the happiest Blanche had ever
known. She felt wrapped in the devotion of
her husband and her family, and exalted by her
love for her child. At moments she feared
that she could not live through such happiness.
Sometimes she would fancy that all
her sufferings had been only a dream, and
then she would turn and find with a thrill of
joy the babe lying beside her. Jules would
sit by the bed holding her hand, and making
jokes about their daughter's future. They
had decided that she should be called
Jeanne, and no one but Father Dumény
should baptize her.</p>

<p class="indent">One morning, when Blanche was sitting up
in bed for the first time, Jules entered the
room with a letter in his hand and in his
face a look of exultation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's from Marshall,&quot; he said, &quot;from the
Hippodrome in London, you know. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
wants me to make a contract for six months,
from the first of January. I was afraid he
might back out because we held off so long.
But this makes it all right. You'll have
more than a month to get strong again and
to practise in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules was so excited by the prospect that
he did not notice the look of alarm that had
appeared in his wife's eyes. She lay still,
with one arm extended on the coverlet, her
head leaning to one side, and her dark
hair making a background for her white
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'We want you to open on the first,'&quot;
Jules read aloud. &quot;'Let us hear from you
as soon as possible and we will send on the
contract for your signature.' Of course,&quot; he
went on, folding the note, &quot;we must jump
at it. What do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment she looked at him without
speaking. Then she replied weakly, &quot;Do
what you think best, Jules.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good!&quot; he said, jumping up. &quot;I'll
write now. We've lost a lot of time, you
know, and we must make up for it when we
get back to work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
&quot;Do you&mdash;do you think I'll be strong
enough?&quot; she went on, as if she hadn't heard
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Strong enough!&quot; he laughed. &quot;Of
course you'll be strong enough in seven
weeks more. You're nearly your old self
now,&quot; he added affectionately. &quot;Don't you
worry about that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he had closed the door and left her
alone, she felt as if her body were sinking
into the bed from weakness. The circus
again! That ghastly plunge! Since the
birth of her child she had hardly thought of
it. Now the thought horrified her! How
could she leave her babe and risk her life
night after night? Perhaps some night&mdash;oh!
it was too horrible. She couldn't, she
couldn't! She lifted her hands to her face
as if to shut out the horror of the thought.
Then she turned to the little Jeanne who
was sleeping beside her, and drew her close
to her bosom.</p>

<p class="indent">She had lost courage! It would never
come back to her. When Jules returned
she would tell him, and she would beg him,
for Jeanne's sake, to give up that engagement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
in London till she felt well again.
Oh, if they could only leave the circus forever!
If she could only do as other women
did, devote her life to her child. The circus
was no place for a mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Then it suddenly flashed upon her that if
she said these things to Jules he would urge
her to place Jeanne in her mother's care
while they were in England; but to that she
would never consent, never. She would
rather give up performing altogether. Yes,
when Jules came back she would speak of this.
He loved the circus, but for Jeanne's sake he
would give it up, she knew he would.</p>

<p class="indent">But when Jules did return, he was so
enthusiastic about the engagement in London
that she did not dare oppose it. &quot;Think of
the sensation we'll make there!&quot; he said.
&quot;How those stupid English will open their
eyes! And then we'll surely have big offers
from other places. After a London success
we can make a fortune in America. They
say the Americans are crazy over everything
that makes a hit in London. Oh,&quot; he went
on, stretching his arms and yawning, &quot;it will
be a relief to get out of this dull old town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
Think of the months we've wasted here.
I feel rusty already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Something in his tone as well as his words
frightened her, and a feeling of helplessness
came over her when he put his hand on her
forehead and said gently: &quot;You must try to
get strong as soon as possible, dear. Think
of all the practising you'll have to do for
your plunge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned her head away, and he observed
nothing strange in her manner. She
wanted to speak of taking Jeanne with them,
but a fear that he might object restrained
her.</p>

<p class="indent">Two days later, when her mother and
Jules were in the room together, Madame
Berthier, with apparent carelessness, asked
what they were going to do with the little
one while they were travelling. &quot;Of course
you can't carry her about with you. So you'd
better leave her with me. I'll take the best
of care of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was startled by the light that flashed
into her daughter's eyes. &quot;No, no!&quot;
Blanche cried. &quot;We shall keep her with us
always. I couldn't bear to leave her here.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
I couldn't&mdash;I couldn't go away without
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Berthier and Jules exchanged
glances, and Blanche saw that her intuition
was correct. They had been discussing the
project of leaving the child in Boulogne.
She felt as if they were conspiring against her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you think it would be better if
your mother&mdash;&quot; Jules began, but Blanche
cut him short.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We shall have Madeleine. She will help
me to take care of Jeanne. I couldn't go
without her,&quot; she repeated, with tears in her
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, there!&quot; said Madame Berthier,
becoming alarmed. &quot;Have your own way.
Perhaps it's better that you should keep the
child with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche read annoyance in her husband's
face, but she said nothing. A few moments
later, Madame Berthier left the room and
Jules followed. She knew they had gone to
discuss the little scene that had just taken
place. But she resolved that she would
not give up the child! Rather than do that
she would stay in Boulogne.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
The fear of being separated from Jeanne,
made her decide not to refer in any way
to her terror of the plunge. That might
strengthen Jules' belief that the presence
of the child disturbed her, and he might
insist on a separation. Besides, she tried to
convince herself that as she grew stronger
her nervousness would disappear. It must
of course be due solely to her weak condition.
Once restored to health, the plunge
would be, as it always had been, merely part
of her daily routine.</p>

<p class="indent">But in spite of her rapidly increasing
strength, Blanche found that after three
weeks she was still depressed by the thought
of her season in London. Jules complained
that she was devoting herself too much to
Jeanne; she must drive out more, and walk
with the girls, and give more time to her
exercises. Her mother, too, grew severe
with her. &quot;One would think there never
was another child in the world,&quot; she said,
and then Blanche suspected that Jules had
been complaining of her. &quot;The little one is
a dear, and I love her,&quot; Madame Berthier
continued, &quot;but you have your work to do,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
and you must think of that too. No wonder
Jules is growing impatient.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules had already received the contract for
the engagement at the Hippodrome, and on
signing it at his request, Blanche had had a
horrible fancy that she was putting her signature
to a warrant for her own doom. Once
she thought of confiding her fear to her
mother, but her mother would be sure to
repeat what she said to Jules. At any cost,
she felt she must hide it from him. Then
she determined to tell Father Dumény, but
when the moment came she had not courage
to put her feeling into words, and she was
ashamed of it as a superstition. So she
decided that she would keep the miserable
secret to herself, finding no relief save in gusts
of weeping when she was alone with the child.</p>

<p class="indent">Once Jules found her with traces of tears
in her eyes. &quot;What's the matter?&quot; he
asked gently, taking her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned her head away. &quot;I don't
feel well,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at her closely. &quot;You'll be
well when you get back to your work.
That's what the matter is. You aren't used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
to being idle. The best thing for us to do
is to leave here the day after Christmas.
That will give you nearly a week for
practice in London, and we'll have time to
look about for rooms there. Since we are
going to have Jeanne with us, we'll want to
take an apartment in some quiet street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he went away she sat for a long
time without speaking. In a week they
would be far away from this place, among
strangers. She wondered why she had not
suffered so on leaving home before. Until
now she had regarded the circus as part of
her life; she had not hoped for any other
kind of life. How strange it was that Jules
should love it so! Sometimes it seemed&mdash;&mdash;But
it was right that she should go on with
her work, for she must earn money for the
little Jeanne now. Perhaps in a few years
she would make a fortune, and then Jules
could not object to her leaving the circus.
But before a few years passed she would be
obliged to go through her performance more
than a thousand times. At this thought her
heart seemed to stop beating, and then it
thumped against her side.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
Their Christmas in Boulogne at Monsieur
Berthier's house reminded them of their <i>fête</i>
in Paris of the year before. Berthier himself
led in the gayety, and the girls were in
the wildest spirits. Blanche sat among them
with the child in her arms, looking, as Jules
said, as if she were posing for a Madonna.
In the evening Father Dumény came to
bid his friends good-bye. He pretended
to pinch the little Jeanne on the cheek, and
he made jokes with Blanche about her terror
before the child's birth. &quot;She's the healthiest
baby I've ever baptized,&quot; he said. &quot;You
should have heard her roar when I poured
the water on her head. That's a good sign.
I suppose you'll make a great performer of
her too,&quot; he continued, smiling into the face
of the mother, but growing serious when he
saw the effect of the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never!&quot; exclaimed Blanche.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We're going to earn a fortune for her,&quot;
said Jules with a smile. &quot;So she won't have
to work at all. We'll settle down in Paris
and make a fine lady of her, and marry her
into the nobility.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche did not speak again for a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
time. They knew she was depressed at the
thought of leaving home the next day. When
Father Dumény rose, he took a letter from
the pocket of his long black coat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I almost forgot about this. Here's the
introduction I promised you to my friends
in London. You will like Mrs. Tate, my
dear,&quot; he said to Blanche, &quot;and she'll make
a great pet of the little one. She hasn't
any children of her own, poor woman. Be
sure to go to see them,&quot; he concluded, &quot;and
present my compliments to them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he was gone, Jules shrugged his
shoulders and turned to his wife. &quot;What
do we want to meet those people for?&quot;
he said. &quot;What will they care about
us?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The next day they left Boulogne, after
many farewell injunctions from the Berthiers,
and much weeping on the part of Blanche
and her sisters. Blanche stood for a long
time with Madeleine, who held the little
Jeanne in her arms, waving farewell to her kindred
on the wharf, and watching the shores
of France recede from her gaze. When the
last vestige of land disappeared in the wintry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
fog and she found herself shut in by the
shoreless sea, she turned away with a feeling
of hopeless weariness. She had a morbid
presentiment that she was leaving home
forever.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span></p>

<h2>XIII</h2>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate ran her eyes over the pile
of letters at her plate on the breakfast-table.
She was a large, florid woman of
forty, verging on stoutness, with an abundance
of reddish-brown hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a lot of mail!&quot; she said to her
husband, who was absorbed in reading the
&quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot;&mdash;a small man, with black
hair and moustache tinged with gray, and
small black eyes finely wrinkled at the corners.
&quot;Here's a letter from Amy dated at
Cannes. They must have left Paris sooner
than they intended; and here's something
from Fanny Mayo,&mdash;an invitation to dinner,
I suppose. Fanny told me she wanted us
to meet the Presbreys next week,&mdash;some
people she knew in Bournemouth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fanny's always taking up new people,&quot;
said Tate from behind his paper, &quot;and dropping
them in a month.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
&quot;And here's something else with a French
stamp on it. Let me see. From Boulogne?
It must be from Father Dumény. Yes, I
recognize the handwriting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another subscription, I suppose,&quot; her
husband grunted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He hasn't written for nearly a year. I
wonder what started him this time. What
a dear old soul he is! Do you remember
the night we took him out to a restaurant in
Paris and he was so afraid of being seen? I
always laugh when I think of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's he got to say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With her knife, Mrs. Tate cut one end of
the letter open, and her eye wandered slowly
down the page.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's been ill, he says, but he's able
to be about now. He came near running
over here last summer, but he couldn't get
away.&quot; For a few moments Mrs. Tate was
absorbed in reading; then she exclaimed
with a curious little laugh: &quot;How funny!
Listen to this, will you? He's left what he
really wrote for till the end,&mdash;like a woman.
He wants us to look after a <i>protégée</i> of his,
a girl that he baptized, the daughter of an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
acrobat. Did you ever hear of such a thing?
She's in the circus herself, and she's going
to appear at the Hippodrome next week.
She performs on the trapeze, and then she
dives backward from the roof of the building&mdash;backward,
mind you! Could anything
be more terrible?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think she'd be right in your
line,&quot; Tate replied without lifting his eyes
from his paper. &quot;She'll be something new.
You can make a lion of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't be impertinent, Percy. This is a
very serious matter. It seems the girl's
married and had a child about two months
ago. She's going to resume her performances.
She doesn't know a soul in London;
so she'll be all alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you said she had a husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I did. He's given them a letter to
us, but he doesn't think they'll present it.
I suppose those theatrical people live in a
world of their own. But of course I shall
go to see her. Perhaps I can do something
for her. Anyway, it'll be interesting
to meet an acrobat. I've never known one
in my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
&quot;As I said,&quot; her husband remarked, turning
to his bacon and eggs, &quot;you can introduce
her into society. People must be tired
of meeting artists and actors and musicians.
She'll be a novelty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're very disagreeable to-day, Percy,&quot;
Mrs. Tate responded amiably, after sipping
the coffee that had been steaming beside her
plate. &quot;You are always attributing the meanest
motives to everything I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He gave a short laugh. &quot;But you must
acknowledge that you do some pretty queer
things, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She ignored the remark, and a moment
later she went on briskly: &quot;I must go and
see this acrobat woman&mdash;whoever she is.
If I don't&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's her name?&quot; Tate asked, turning
to his paper and searching for the theatrical
columns.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madame Jules Le Baron, Father Dumény
calls her. But I suppose she must
have a stage name. Most of them have.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't see that name in 'Under the
Clock!' The Hippodrome? No, it isn't
there. I wonder if this can be the one:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
'On Monday evening next, Mademoiselle
Blanche, the celebrated French acrobat, will
give her remarkable performance on the
trapeze and her great dive from the top of
the Hippodrome.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it must be. Mademoiselle Blanche!
How stagey it sounds! I wonder what she's
like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We might go to see her first and then
we could tell whether she's possible or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go to the Hippodrome!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, why not? It's perfectly respectable.
Only it doesn't happen to be fashionable.
In Paris, you know, it's the thing
to attend the circus. Don't you remember
the La Marches took us one night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and I remember there was a dreadful
creature&mdash;she must have weighed three
hundred pounds&mdash;who walked the tight-rope
and nearly frightened me to death. I thought
she'd come down on my head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then it's understood that we're to go
on Monday? If we go at all we might as
well be there the first night. It'll be more
interesting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
Mrs. Percy Tate was a personage in London.
For several years before her marriage,
at the age of twenty-five, she had been
known as an heiress and a belle. Even then
she had a reputation for independence of
character, and for an indefatigable zeal for
reforming the world. Her name stood at
the head of several charitable societies, and
she was also a member of many clubs for the
improvement of the physical and spiritual
condition of the human race. Since her
marriage she had grown somewhat milder;
her friends used to say that Percy Tate had
&quot;trained&quot; her. They also said that she had
&quot;made&quot; him; without her money he would
never have become a member of the rich
firm of Welling and Company.</p>

<p class="indent">Percy Tate's business associates, however,
knew the fallacy of this uncharitable opinion.
With his dogged determination and his keen
insight into the intricacies of finance, Tate
was sure of forging ahead in time, with or
without backing. His association with Welling
and Company gave the house even greater
strength than it had had before; for in addition
to his reputation as a financier, he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
made his name a synonym for stanch integrity.
He had passed sixteen happy years
with his wife, wisely directed her charities,
wholesomely ridiculed her enthusiasms, followed
her into the Catholic Church, where
he was quite as sincere if a much less ardent
worshipper; and in all the serious things of
life he treated her, not as an inferior to be
patronized, but as an equal that he respected,
with no display of sentiment, but with sincere
devotion. She, on her part, was amused by
his humor and guided by his advice, though
she often pretended to ignore it; and she
never allowed any of her numerous undertakings
to interfere with her regard for his
comfort or the happiness of her home.</p>

<p class="indent">The manager of the Hippodrome had extensively
advertised the appearance of Mademoiselle
Blanche, and on Monday night
the amphitheatre was crowded. The Tates
arrived early in order to see the whole performance;
as they had never been at the
Hippodrome before, the evening promised
to be amusing for them. Tate, however, became
so interested in the menagerie through
which they passed before entering the portion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
of the vast building devoted to the exhibitions
in the ring that they remained there more
than an hour. The interval between their
taking seats and the appearance of the acrobat
rather bored them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish they'd hurry up and let her come
out,&quot; said Mrs. Tate. &quot;And yet I almost
dread seeing her make that horrible plunge.
This must be the first time she's done it
since the birth of her baby. Isn't it really
shocking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I suppose these people are as much
entitled to babies as any other people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She cast a reproachful glance at him, and
did not reply for a moment. Then she said:
&quot;But what must her feelings be now&mdash;just
as she's getting ready?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say she's glad to get back to her
work and earn her salary again. Her husband
probably doesn't earn anything. Those
fellows never do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She must be frightened nearly to death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tate laughed softly. &quot;You'll die from
worrying about other people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are they doing now?&quot; Mrs. Tate
asked, turning her eyes to the ring. &quot;I suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
that rope they're letting down is for her
to climb up on, and that's the net she'll fall
into. How gracefully that trapeze swings! I
feel quite excited. Every one else is too.
Can't you see it in their faces? There must
be thousands of people here. How strange
they look! Such coarse faces.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's the great British middle class.
This is just the kind of thing they like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It reminds me of pictures of the Colosseum.
I can almost fancy their turning their
thumbs down. Here she comes. How light
she is on her feet! And isn't she pretty!
But she looks awfully thin and delicate, and
she's as pale as a ghost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll attract all the people round us.
Of course she's pale. She's probably powdered
up to the eyes, like the women we
used to see in Paris.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How lightly she goes up that rope,&quot;
Mrs. Tate whispered, &quot;and what wonderful
arms she has! Just like a man's. They
look as if they didn't belong to her body.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silently and dexterously Blanche reached
the main trapeze, and for a moment she sat
there, with her arms crooked against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
rope on either side, and rubbing her hands.
For the first time during her career she
was terrified in the ring. She had hoped
that as soon as she resumed her work
the terror she had felt since Jeanne's birth
would pass away. Now, however, it made
her so weak that she feared she was going
to fall.</p>

<p class="indent">She was thinking of the child as she had
seen her crowing in the crib. If anything
should happen to her she might never see
Jeanne again. She was vaguely conscious
of the vast mass of people below her, waiting
for her to move. She took a long breath
and nerved herself for the start, before making
her spring to the trapeze below; she
must have courage for the sake of the little
Jeanne, she said to herself. Mechanically
she began to sway forward and backward;
then she shot into the air, and with a sensation
of surprise and delight she continued
her performance.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate watched her with an expression
of mingled fear, interest, and pleasure in her
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn't she the most wonderful creature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
you ever saw, Percy?&quot; she cried, clutching
her husband's arm. &quot;It's horrible, yet I
can't help looking. Suppose she should
fall!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She'd merely drop into the net. There's
nothing very dangerous about what she's
doing now. Keep still.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never saw anything more graceful.
She <i>is</i> grace itself, isn't she? See how her
hair flies; I should think it would get into
her eyes and blind her. I shall speak to her
about that when I see her. I shall certainly
<i>go</i> to see her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a round of applause, Blanche finished
her performance on the trapeze and then
began her posing on the rope, whirling
slowly, with a rhythmic succession of motions
to the net. Then Jules, in evening
dress, with a large diamond gleaming in his
shirt-front, stepped out on the net, and for
an instant they conferred together. Suddenly
she clapped her hands, bounded on the rope
again, and while Jules held it to steady her
motion, she climbed hand over hand to the
top of the building. There she sat, looking
in the distance like a white bird ready to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
take flight, her dark hair streaming around
her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel as if I were going to faint,&quot; Mrs.
Tate whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">Her husband glanced at her quickly.
&quot;Yes, you'd better&mdash;in this crowd. A
fine panic you'd create! Want to go
out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed to pull herself together. &quot;No,
I think I shall be able to bear it. If I can't,
I'll look away. What's that he's saying?
What horrible English he speaks! I can't
understand a word. <i>Oh!</i>&quot; she gasped, clutching
her husband by one arm and holding
him firmly as Blanche dropped backward
and whirled through the air; and this exclamation
she repeated in a tone of horrified
relief when the girl struck the net, bounded
into the air again, and landed on her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">They rose with the applauding crowd and
started to leave the place. &quot;In my opinion,&quot;
said Mrs. Tate, clinging to her husband's
arm and drawing her wrap closely around
her, &quot;in my opinion such exhibitions are
outrageous. There ought to be a law against
them. Think of that poor little creature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
going through that every night. Of course
she'll be killed sometime. I wonder if she's
afraid. I should think she'd expect every
night to be her last.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What nonsense you're talking. Of
course those people don't feel like that.
If they did they'd never go into the business.
It's second nature to them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they're <i>human</i> just like the rest
of us, and that woman is a mother,&quot; Mrs.
Tate insisted. &quot;Don't you suppose she
thinks of her baby before she makes that
terrible dive? It's a shame that her husband
should allow her to do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There you are, trying to regulate the
affairs of the world again. Why don't you
let people alone? They'd be a good deal
happier, and so would you. Her husband
probably likes to have her do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I shall go to see her anyway,&quot; Mrs.
Tate cried with determination. &quot;Then I
can find out all about her for myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the next three weeks Mrs. Tate was
absorbed by various duties in connection
with her charitable societies. One morning,
however, she suddenly realized that she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
neglected to comply with Father Dumény's
request, and she resolved to put off her other
engagements for the afternoon and call at
once on the acrobat; if she didn't go then,
there was no knowing when she could go.
At four o'clock she found herself stepping
into a hansom in front of her house in
Cavendish Square.</p>

<p class="indent">The address that Father Dumény had sent
led her to a little French hotel with a narrow,
dark entrance, dimly lighted by an odorous
lamp. She poked about in the place for
a moment, wondering how she was to find
any one; then a door which she had not
observed was thrown open, and she was confronted
by a little man with a very waxed
moustache, who smiled and asked in broken
English what Madame wanted. She stammered
that she was looking for Madame
Le Baron, and the little man at once called
a <i>garçon</i> in a greasy apron, who led the
way up the narrow stairs. When they had
reached the second landing the boy rapped
on the door, and Mrs. Tate stood panting
behind him. For several moments there
was no answer; then heavy steps could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
heard approaching, and a moment later
Madeleine's broad figure, silhouetted by the
light from the windows from behind, stood
before them. Mrs. Tate saw at a glance that
she was French, and addressed her in her
own language.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Mais oui</i>,&quot; Madeleine replied. &quot;Madame
is at home. Will Madame have the
goodness to enter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say that I'm Father Dumény's friend,
please,&quot; said Mrs. Tate as she gave Madeleine
a card. Then she glanced at one
corner of the room, where a large cradle,
covered with a lace canopy, had caught her
eye. &quot;Is the baby here?&quot; she asked
quickly, going toward it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, no&mdash;not now. She sometimes
sleeps here in the morning; but she is with
her mother in the other room now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine disappeared, and Mrs. Tate's
eyes roved around the room. She recognized
it at once as the typical English lodging-house
drawing-room; she had seen many
rooms just like it before, when she had called
on American friends living for a time in
London. It was large and oblong, facing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
the tall houses on the opposite side of the
street that cut off much of the light; the wall
paper was ugly and sombre, and the carpet,
with its large flowery pattern, together with
the lounge and chairs, completed an effect
of utter dreariness.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate wondered how people could
live in such places; she should simply go
mad if she had to stay in a room like this.
Then she wondered why Madame Le Baron
hadn't brightened up the apartment a bit;
the photographs on the mantel, in front of
the large French mirror, together with the
cradle in the corner, were the only signs it
gave of being really inhabited. How vulgar
those prints on the wall were! They and
the mirror were the only French touches
visible, and they contrasted oddly with their
surroundings. While Mrs. Tate was comfortably
meditating on the vast superiority
of England to France, the door leading to
the next room opened and Blanche entered
the room. She looked so domestic in her
simple dress of blue serge that for an instant
her caller did not recognize her.</p>

<p class="indent">She held out her hand timidly. &quot;Father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
Dumény has spoken to me about you,&quot; she
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Father Dumény must think I am an extremely
rude person. I meant to come
weeks ago,&quot; Mrs. Tate replied, clasping the
hand and looking down steadily into the
pale face. &quot;But I've been busy&mdash;so busy,
I've had hardly a minute to myself. However,
I did go to see you perform.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, at the Hippodrome?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, the very first night. Mr. Tate and
I went together. We were both&mdash;er&mdash;wonderfully
impressed. I don't think I ever
saw anything more wonderful in my life than
that plunge of yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate adjusted herself in the chair
near the window, and Blanche took the
opposite seat. &quot;I'm glad you liked it,&quot;
she said with a sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Liked it. I can't really say I did like it.
I must confess it rather horrified me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does some people. My mother never
likes to see me do it&mdash;though I've done it
for a great many years now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But doesn't it&mdash;doesn't it make you
nervous sometimes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;I never used to think of it&mdash;before my
baby was born.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, the baby! May I see her? Just
a peep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was asleep when I left,&quot; Blanche
replied, unconsciously lowering her voice as
if the child in the next room might know
she was being talked about; &quot;but she will
wake up soon. She always wakes about
this time. Madeleine is with her now, and
she'll dress her and bring her in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a quarter of an hour they talked about
the little Jeanne, and Blanche, inspired by
Mrs. Tate's vivid interest and sympathy,
grew animated in describing the baby's
qualities; when she was born she weighed
nearly nine pounds, and she had not been
sick a day. Then she had grown so! You
could hardly believe it was the same child.
She very rarely cried,&mdash;almost never at
night. Mrs. Tate had heard mothers talk
like that before, but Blanche's <i>naïveté</i> lent
a new charm to the narration; she kept in
mind, however, their first topic, and at the
next opportunity she returned to it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then what do you do with the child at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
night?&quot; she asked. &quot;I suppose your servant
goes to the circus with you, doesn't
she? Of course you can't leave the baby
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, no,&quot; Blanche replied. &quot;We have a
little girl to stay with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate was surprised. So these circus
people lived as other people did, with servants
to wait on them, with a nurse for the
child. She had instinctively thought of them
as vagabonds. On discovering that they
were well cared for, she had a sensation
very like disappointment; they seemed to
be in no need of help of any sort. She was
curious to know more of the life of this girl,
who seemed so <i>naïve</i> and had such a curious
look of sadness in her eyes. Mrs. Tate
deftly led Blanche to talk about her husband,
and in a few minutes, by her questions
and her quick intelligence, she fancied that
she understood the condition of this extraordinary
<i>ménage</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Percy had been right; the wife supported
the family and the husband was a mere
hanger-on; but it was evident from the way
he was mentioned that the romance still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
lasted. Then Blanche made a reference to
Jules which led her visitor to make inquiries
with regard to him, and these changed her
view of the situation. So, before marriage,
Monsieur had been in business, and he had
probably given it up to follow his wife in her
wanderings. She surmised that they were
not absolutely dependent on the circus for
their daily bread; perhaps this accounted for
their comfortable way of living.</p>

<p class="indent">While apparently absorbed in conversation
Mrs. Tate continued this train of thought.
She had never known any one connected
with the circus before, she explained with a
smile; people who lived in London all the
time were apt to be so very narrow and ignorant;
but she wanted to hear all about it,
and Madame must tell her. Blanche was
able to tell very little, for she was not used to
discussing her work. By adroit questioning,
however, Mrs. Tate led her on to an account
of her early career from her first appearance
as a child with her father to her development
into a &quot;star&quot; performer.</p>

<p class="indent">The narrative seemed to her wildly interesting.
How fascinating it would be if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
could persuade the girl to relate her story in
a drawing-room! It would be the sensation
of the winter. But this poor child never
could talk in public, even in her own tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But do tell me,&quot; said Mrs. Tate, when
Blanche had described the months her father
had spent in teaching her to make the great
plunge. &quot;Doesn't it hurt your back? I
should think that striking with full force day
after day on that padded net would destroy
the nervous system of a giant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche smiled and shook her head. &quot;It
never used to hurt. I've only felt it lately,
since the baby was born,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then it does hurt now?&quot; Mrs. Tate cried
eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometimes. I feel so tired in the morning
now. I never used to; and sometimes
when I wake up my back aches very much.
But I try not to think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, my dear child, you ought to think
of it. You mustn't allow yourself to be injured&mdash;perhaps
for life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche turned pale. &quot;Do you think it
can be serious?&quot; she asked timidly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate saw that she had made a false
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
step. &quot;Of course not&mdash;not <i>serious</i>. It's
probably nothing at all. I haven't a doubt
a physician could stop it easily. Have you
spoken to any one about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; not even to my husband. I
shouldn't like to tell him. It would make
him unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate became thoughtful. &quot;I wonder
if Dr. Broughton couldn't do something for
you. He's our physician, and he's the
kindest soul in the world. I'm always sending
him to people. Suppose I should ask
him to come and call on you some day.
Perhaps he'll tell you there's nothing the
matter, and then you won't be worried any
more.&quot; She glanced into the pale face and
was startled by the look she saw there. &quot;Oh,
you needn't be afraid,&quot; she laughed. &quot;He
won't hurt you. But, of course, if you don't
want him to come, I won't send him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche clasped her hands and dropped
her eyes. &quot;I think I should like to have
him come if&mdash;if&mdash;my husband&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he needn't know anything about
it,&quot; said Mrs. Tate, with feminine delight at
the prospect of secrecy. &quot;We won't tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
him anything. If he meets Monsieur Le
Baron here you can just say I sent him to
call on you. Besides, he can come some
time when your husband isn't here,&quot; she
added with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jules generally goes out in the afternoon,&quot;
Blanche replied, feeling guilty at the
thought of concealing anything from him.
&quot;He likes to read the French papers in a
<i>café</i> in the Strand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I'll tell Dr. Broughton to come
some afternoon. He'll be delighted. I
don't believe <i>he's</i> ever known an acrobat
either,&quot; she laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">They talked more of Blanche's symptoms,
and Mrs. Tate speedily discovered that since
the birth of the baby Blanche had not been
free from terror of her work; every night
she feared might be her last. She did not
confess this directly, but Mrs. Tate gathered
it from several intimations and from her own
observations. She felt elated. What an interesting
case! She had never heard of anything
like it before. This poor child was
haunted with a horrible terror! This accounted
for the pitiful look of distress in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
her eyes. Then Mrs. Tate's generous heart
fairly yearned with sympathy; but this she
was careful to conceal. She saw that by
displaying it she would do far more harm
than good; so she pretended to be amused
at the possibility of Blanche's injuring herself
in making the plunge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must have become second nature to
you,&quot; she said, &quot;after all these years. You're
probably a little tired and nervous. Dr.
Broughton will give you a tonic that will
restore your old confidence. Meantime,&quot;
she added enthusiastically, &quot;I'm going
to take care of you. I'm coming to see
you very often, and I shall expect you to
come to see me. Let me think; this is
Thursday. On Sunday night you and Monsieur
Le Baron must come and dine with us
at seven o'clock. We'll be all alone. I
sha'n't ask any one. But wait a minute.
Why wouldn't that be a good way for your
husband to meet Dr. Broughton? I'll ask
him to come, too. He often looks in on
Sundays. That will be delightful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She rose to her feet and shook out her
skirts. &quot;I suppose I must go without seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
the baby. But I shall&mdash;&mdash;&quot; She looked
quickly around at the clicking sound that
seemed to come from the door. Then the
door opened, and Jules, in a heavy fur-trimmed
coat and silk hat, stood before
her. She recognized him at once, and as
he bowed hesitatingly, she extended her
hand and relieved the awkwardness of the
situation. &quot;I won't wait for Madame to
introduce me,&quot; she said, just as Blanche was
murmuring her name.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you are the lady Father Dumény
spoke to us about!&quot; Jules said with a
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; and your wife and I have become
the best of friends already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you've made friends with the
baby too, I hope,&quot; Jules replied, removing
his coat and throwing it over a chair. She
liked his face more than she had done
at the Hippodrome; he had a good eye,
and, for a Frenchman, a remarkably clear
complexion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; she's asleep,&quot; Blanche replied.
&quot;I asked Madeleine to bring her in if she
woke up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
&quot;But you must see her,&quot; Jules insisted.
&quot;I'll go and take a peep at her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He went to the door leading to the next
room, opened it softly, and glanced in.
Then he made a sign that the others were
to follow, and he tiptoed toward the bed
where Jeanne lay sleeping, her face rosy
with health, and her little hands tightly
closed. Madeleine, who had been sitting
beside the bed, rose as they approached
and showed her mouthful of teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments they stood around the
child, smiling at one another and without
speaking. Then they tiptoed out of the
room, and closed the door behind them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall come again soon some morning,&quot;
Mrs. Tate whispered, as if still afraid of disturbing
the child, &quot;when the baby's awake.&quot;
Then she went on in a louder tone: &quot;She's
a dear. I know I shall become very fond
of her. And you're coming to us next
Sunday night,&quot; she added, as she bade
Jules good-bye. &quot;Your wife has promised.
I shall expect you both. Perhaps I shall
come before then; I want to get acquainted
with Jeanne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
She kissed Blanche on both cheeks, after
the French fashion. &quot;I sha'n't forget, you
know. We have great secrets together already,&quot;
she laughed, turning to Jules as she
passed out of the door.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span></p>

<h2>XIV</h2>

<p class="indent">As soon as Percy Tate confronted his
wife at the table that night he saw
that something was on her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You've been to see those circus people,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you know that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, clairvoyance,&mdash;my subtle insight
into the workings of your brain!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose Hawkins told you. Well, I
<i>have</i> been to see them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tate began to pick at the bread beside his
plate. He often became preoccupied when
he knew his wife wanted him to ask questions;
this was his favorite way of teasing
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's the strangest <i>ménage</i> I ever saw in
my life,&quot; Mrs. Tate exclaimed at last, unable
to keep back the news any longer. &quot;And
it's just as I thought it would be. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
poor little creature simply lives in terror of
being killed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tate rolled his eyes. &quot;'In the midst of
life we are in death,'&quot; he said solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's altogether too serious a matter to
be made a joke of, Percy. If you could
have heard&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, my dear, you know what I told
you. You went to see that woman with the
deliberate expectation of finding her a person
to be sympathized with, and I can see
that you've imagined a lot of nonsense
about her. Why in the world don't you
let such people alone? You belong in your
place and she belongs in hers, and the
world is big enough to hold you both without
obliging you to come together. You
can't understand her feelings any more than
she can understand yours. You wonder how
you'd feel if you were in her place; you
can't realize that if you <i>were</i> in her place
you'd be an altogether different person. If
you had to go through her performances, of
course you'd be scared to death; but you
forget she's been brought up to do those
things; it's her business, her life. I knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
you'd go there and work up a lot of ridiculous
sympathy, and badger that woman for
nothing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the beginning of this speech Mrs. Tate
had sat back in her chair with an expression
of patient resignation in her face. When
her husband finished she breathed a long
sigh. &quot;I hope you've said it all, Percy.
You're so tiresome when you make those
long harangues. Besides, you've only succeeded
in showing that you don't understand
the case at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, as they finished their soup, Mrs.
Tate gave an account of her call of the
afternoon, ending with a graphic repetition
of the talk with Blanche about the pains
in her back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall certainly tell Dr. Broughton about
it,&quot; she cried. &quot;That poor child&mdash;she
really <i>is</i> nothing <i>but</i> a child&mdash;she's just
killing herself by inches, and her husband
is worse than a brute to let the thing
go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you want to stop it and take away
their only means of support.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn't their only means of support. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
seems the husband has money. That makes
it all the worse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, let me say right here, my dear, I
wash my hands of this affair. If you want to
rush in and upset those people's lives, go
ahead, but I'll have nothing to do with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish you wouldn't scold me so, Percy.
It seems to me I usually bear the consequences
of what I do. And I don't see
what harm there can be in consulting Dr.
Broughton. You're always cracking him
up yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tate burst into a loud laugh. &quot;If that
isn't just like a woman! Turning it onto
poor old Broughton.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, sometimes you're so <i>aggravating</i>,
Percy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two days later, in spite of her husband's
opposition, Mrs. Tate consulted Dr. Broughton,
and he promised, as soon as he could,
to call some morning at the little hotel in
Albemarle Street. Before he appeared there
Mrs. Tate ingratiated herself into the affections
of the family. As Blanche grew more
familiar with her, she confided to her many
details of her life, and Mrs. Tate speedily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
possessed the chief facts in connection with
it. These facts did not increase her esteem
for Jules, whose days, in spite of his duties as
his wife's manager, were spent in what she
regarded as wholly unpardonable idleness.
She also suspected that Jules disliked her;
it must have been he who sent word that
they would be unable to accept her invitation
for dinner on Sunday evening. This, however,
did not prevent their being invited for
the following Sunday. Mrs. Tate was determined
to secure her husband's opinion of
her new <i>protégés</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Before Sunday came Dr. Broughton unexpectedly
made his appearance in the Tates'
drawing-room one evening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've seen your acrobat,&quot; he said to the
figure in yellow silk and lace, reading beside
the lamp. &quot;Don't get up. Been out? I
hardly thought I'd find you in; you're such
a pair of worldlings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We came away early. I had a headache,&quot;
said Tate, shading his eyes with one hand
and offering the other to the visitor. &quot;Or,
rather, I pretended I had.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Doctor, a short, stout man of fifty, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
grayish brown hair, and little red whiskers
jutting out from either side of his face, and
with enormous eyebrows shading his keen
eyes, gathered his coat-tails in his hand, and
took a seat on the couch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's late for a call&mdash;must be after ten.
But I knew this lady of yours would want
to hear about her acrobat. Nice little creature,
isn't she? Seems ridiculous she should
belong to a circus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She doesn't belong there,&quot; Mrs. Tate
replied, briskly inserting a paper-knife in her
book and laying the book on the little table
beside her. &quot;I've never seen any one so
utterly misplaced. Did you have a talk with
her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;a talk. That was all; but that
was enough. Her husband was out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O, you conspirators!&quot; Tate exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you've satisfied yourself about
her?&quot; said his wife, ignoring him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. She has a very common complaint,
a form of meningitis; slumbering meningitis,
it's often called. Many people have it without
knowing it; and she might have had it
even if she hadn't taken to thumping her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
spine half a dozen times a week.  The
trouble's located in the spine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, I told you so!&quot; exclaimed Mrs.
Tate; and &quot;What a lovely habit women have
of never gloating over anything!&quot; her husband
added amiably.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Percy, I wish you'd keep quiet! Do
you really think it's serious, Doctor?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Doctor held up his hands meditatively,
the ends of the fingers touching, and
slowly lifted his shoulders. &quot;In itself it may
be serious or it may not. Sometimes trouble
of that sort is quiescent for years, and the
patient dies of something else. Sometimes
it resists treatment, and leads to very serious
complications,&mdash;physical and mental. I've
had cases where it has affected the brain
and others where it has led to paralysis. In
this case it is likely to be aggravated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By the diving, you mean?&quot; said Mrs.
Tate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly. That has probably been the
cause of the trouble lately&mdash;if it wasn't the
first cause. It may go on getting worse, or it
may remain as it is for years, or it may disappear
for a time, or possibly, altogether.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
Mrs. Tate breathed what sounded like a
sigh of disappointment. &quot;Then it isn't so
bad as I thought,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment the Doctor hesitated. Then
he replied: &quot;Yes, it's worse. The mere
physical pain that it causes Madame Le
Baron is of comparatively little account. I
think we may be able to stop that. The
peculiarity of the case is the nervousness,
the curious fear that seems to haunt her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In her excitement Mrs. Tate almost bounced
from her seat. &quot;That is <i>exactly</i> what I said.
The poor child hasn't a moment's peace.
It's the most terrible thing I ever heard
of. And to think that that man&mdash;her husband&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's always the husband,&quot; Tate laughed.
&quot;Broughton, why don't you stand up for
your sex?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Percy wants to turn the whole thing into
ridicule. I think it's a shame. I can't tell
you how it has worried me. I feel so&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For Heaven's sake, Broughton, I wish
you'd give my wife something to keep her
from feeling for other people. If you don't,
she'll go mad, and I shall too. She wants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
to regulate the whole universe. I have a
horrible fear that she's going to get round
to me soon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Doctor smiled, and bent his bushy
eyes on the husband and then on the
wife.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a peculiar case,&quot; he repeated
thoughtfully, when they had sat in silence
for several moments. &quot;It couldn't be
treated in the ordinary way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How in the world did you get so much
out of her?&quot; Mrs. Tate asked. &quot;She's the
shyest little creature.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had to work on her sympathies. I
got her to crying,&mdash;and then, of course, the
whole story came out. As you said, she's
haunted by the fear of being killed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that's the baby,&quot; said Mrs. Tate
quickly. &quot;She told me she never had the
least fear till her baby was born.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Doctor lifted his eyebrows. &quot;It's
several things,&quot; he replied dryly, refusing to
take any but the professional view.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they discussed the case in all its aspects.
The haunting fear Dr. Broughton regarded
as the worst feature. &quot;She says when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
she goes into the ring, that usually leaves her;
but if it came back just before she took her
plunge it would kill her. The least miscalculation
would be likely to make her land
on her head in the net, and that would mean
a broken neck. It's terrible work,&mdash;that.
The law ought to put a stop to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The law ought to put a stop to a good
many things that it doesn't,&quot; Mrs. Tate
snapped. &quot;To think that in this age of
civilization&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There she goes, reforming the world
again!&quot; her husband interrupted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if the law doesn't stop it in this
case,&quot; she went on, &quot;<i>I</i> will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a time they turned from the subject
of Blanche and her ills to other themes; but
when, about midnight, Dr. Broughton rose to
leave, Mrs. Tate went back to it. &quot;We're
going to have the Le Barons here for dinner
next Sunday,&quot; she said. &quot;I wish you'd
come in if you can. I want Percy to see
what they're like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She relies on my judgment after all,&quot;
said Tate, following the guest to the door.
As they stood together in the hall, &quot;You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
think the case is serious then?&quot; he asked
quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">The Doctor whispered something in his
ear, and Tate nodded thoughtfully. &quot;And
how do you think it'll end if she doesn't
stop it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Broughton tapped his forehead with
his hand. &quot;This is what I'm most afraid
of.&quot; He seized his stick and thrust it under
his arm. &quot;But giving up her performance,
I'm afraid, would be like giving up her
life. She was practically born in the circus,
you know, and I suspect from what your
wife has told me that her husband fell
in love with her in the circus. Outside
of that she seems to have no interest in
anything,&mdash;except, of course, her family
and her baby. But to take her out of the
circus would be like pulling up a tree by
the roots.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Broughton was so used to making
hurried exits from patients' houses that he
lost no time in getting away from Tate. As
he went down the steps his host stood with
one hand on the knob of the front door,
thinking. The Doctor had unconsciously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
given him a most fascinating suggestion.
Around this his mind played as he walked
back to the drawing-room, where his wife
was yawning, and gathering, some books to
take upstairs. He said nothing to her about
it; before expressing his fancy, he decided
to wait until he saw those curious people.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span></p>

<h2>XV</h2>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate was right in surmising that
Jules had conceived a dislike for
her. The first day he saw her he decided
that she was a tiresome, interfering Englishwoman,
and he watched with annoyance her
growing intimacy with Blanche, whom he
wished to keep wholly to himself. Of his
wife's success at the Hippodrome he felt as
proud as if it were his own; he loved to
read the notices of it in the papers, and
while Blanche was performing, to walk about
in the audience and hear her praises. He
had come to look upon her as part of himself,
as his property; and this sense of proprietorship
added to the fascination that her
performance had for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Though his first ardor of devotion had
passed, he was still tender with her; but his
tenderness always had reference more to her
work than to herself. He watched her as
the owner of a performing animal might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
watched his precious charge. Sometimes he
used to lose patience with her for her devotion
to the little Jeanne; if Jeanne cried at
night she would want to leave the bed to
soothe her. In order to prevent this, Jules
had the child's crib moved into Madeleine's
room, to the secret grief of the mother,
who, however, did not think of resisting
his commands. In his way Jules was fond
of Jeanne; but he could not help thinking
that before she came Blanche had given
all her love to him. However, there was
some excuse for that; but there was no
reason why a stranger like Mrs. Tate should
come in and take possession of them, act
like a member of the family, and put a lot
of silly ideas into his wife's head.</p>

<p class="indent">The mere fact that Mrs. Tate was English
would have been enough to prejudice Jules
against her even if he had not objected to
her personal qualities. He hated the English,
and he hated England, especially London.
Even Blanche, who was blind to his
faults, speedily discovered that his boast of
being a born traveller had no foundation in
fact. On arriving in London he had gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
straight to a French hotel, where he was
served to French cooking by a <i>garçon</i>
trained in the <i>cafés</i> of the <i>Boulevards</i>.
Since then he had associated only with the
few French people he could find in the city;
if he hadn't been eager to read everything
printed about Blanche, he would never have
looked at any but French papers. At home
he spent a large part of his time in ridiculing
the English, just as on his return from
America he had ridiculed the Americans.
Now, at the thought of being obliged to
dine with a lot of those <i>bêtes d'Anglais</i> he
felt enraged. He had already refused one
invitation. Why wasn't that enough for
them? The second he would have refused
too, if Blanche had not insisted that another
refusal would be a discourtesy to Father
Dumény's friends. Ah, Father Dumény, a
fine box he had got them into, the tiresome
old woman that he was, with his foolish jokes
and his rheumatism!</p>

<p class="indent">Jules never forgot that dinner. In the
first place, he was awed by the magnificence
of the Tates' house; it surpassed anything
of the kind he had ever seen in France or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
in America; it had never occurred to him
that the English could have such good
taste. Then, too, in spite of the efforts of
his hosts to make him comfortable, he felt
awkward, ill at ease, out of place. As soon
as he entered the drawing-room, Blanche
was taken upstairs by Mrs. Tate, and Jules
was left with the husband and with Dr.
Broughton.</p>

<p class="indent">A moment later the Doctor disappeared,
and for the next half-hour Jules tried to
maintain a conversation in English. Tate
turned the conversation to life in Paris as
compared with the life of London, but Jules
had so much difficulty in speaking English
that they fell at last into French.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, Blanche sat in the library with
Mrs. Tate and Dr. Broughton, whom she
had not seen since the day of his call upon
her. The Doctor had at once won her confidence,
and since her talk with him she had
felt better, and she fancied that the tonic he
gave her had already benefited her. But
she still had that pain in her back, she said,
and that terrible fear; every night when she
kissed the little Jeanne before going to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
Hippodrome, she felt as if she should never
see the child again. If she didn't stop feeling
like that, she didn't know what would
happen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you could give up the plunge for a
while,&quot; the Doctor suggested, &quot;you'd be
very much better for the rest. Then you
might go back to it, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I'm engaged for the season,&quot;
Blanche replied in French, which the Doctor
readily understood, but refused to speak.
&quot;I can't break my contract.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you could make a compromise,&quot;
Mrs. Tate suggested. &quot;You could go on
with your trapeze performance,&mdash;with everything
except the dive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was really engaged for that,&quot; said
Blanche, a look of dismay appearing in her
face. &quot;There are many others that perform
on the trapeze.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you might try to make some arrangement,&quot;
Mrs. Tate insisted. &quot;Your husband
could talk it over with the managers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, but he would not like it,&quot; Blanche
replied with evident distress. &quot;It would
make him so unhappy if he&mdash;if he knew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
&quot;If he knew you were being made ill by
your work!&quot; Mrs. Tate interrupted. &quot;Of
course it would make him unhappy, and it
would be very strange if it didn't. But
it's much better to have him know it than
for you to go on risking your life every
night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Broughton gave his hostess a glance
that made her quail. A moment later, however,
she gathered herself together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn't mean to say that, dear, but now
that I <i>have</i> said it, there's no use mincing
matters. The Doctor has told me plainly
that if you go on making that plunge every
night in your present state of nervousness it
will certainly result in your death&mdash;in one
way or another. So the only thing for you
to do, for the sake of your baby, and your
husband, and for your own sake too,&mdash;the
only thing for you to do is to stop it, at
least for a time. If you were to break your
neck it would simply be murder,&mdash;yes,
murder,&quot; she repeated, glancing at the Doctor,
who was looking at her with an expression
that showed he thought she was going
too far.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
Tears had begun to trickle down Blanche's
cheeks, and now they turned to sobs. For
a few moments she lost control of herself,
and her frail figure was shaken with grief.
Dr. Broughton said nothing, and he looked
angry. Mrs. Tate paid no attention to him;
she went over to Blanche, took her in her
arms, and began to soothe her. In a few
moments the sobbing ceased, and Mrs. Tate
went on:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's best that you should know this, dear,
though perhaps I've been cruel in telling it
to you so bluntly. We must tell your husband
about it, too. I'm sure he'll be distressed
to hear how much you've suffered, and he'll
be glad to do anything that will help you.
So now we'll send the Doctor away, and
bathe your face with hot water, and go down
to dinner and try to forget about our troubles
for a while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If Jules had not been absorbed in his own
embarrassment at the dinner-table he might
have discovered traces of agitation in his
wife's face. He was secretly execrating the
luck that had brought him among these people,
and he resolved when he returned home to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
tell Blanche that he would have nothing more
to do with them. If she was willing to have
that prying Englishwoman about her all the
time, she could, but she mustn't expect him
to be more than civil to her. The conversation
had turned on English politics, and
as Jules had nothing to offer on the subject,
his enforced silence increased his discomfort.
Mrs. Tate was devoting herself to Blanche,
who sat beside her, relating in French stories
of her life in Paris. Jules felt resentful; no
one paid attention to him; when he dined
out in Paris he was always one of the leaders
in the talk. He wanted to justify himself, to
show these people that he was no fool, that
he was worthy of being the husband of a
celebrity.</p>

<p class="indent">By a fortunate chance, the talk drifted to
American politics, and Jules, seeing his opportunity,
seized it. A few moments later
he was launched on an account of his travels
in the United States. Tate, relieved at having
at last found a topic his guest could discuss,
gave Jules full play, and listened to him
with a light in his eyes that showed his wife
he was secretly amused. Indeed, Jules' criticisms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
of America and his descriptions of
the peculiarities of Americans greatly entertained
them.</p>

<p class="indent">The dinner closed in animated talk, much
to the relief of Mrs. Tate, who feared it
would be a great failure; it made her realize,
however, that as show people the Le
Barons were quite useless. She was afraid
Blanche had been bored; she had been sitting
almost speechless during the meal, sighing
heavily now and then, as if thinking that
in a few hours her respite would be over,
and she would have to return to her horrible
work.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate was quite ready to make any
sacrifice to rescue Blanche from the terrors
of her circus life; in the enthusiasm of
the moment she said to herself, that rather
than let her continue making that plunge,
she would offer to <i>pay</i> her husband what she
earned, in order to take his wife out of the
ring altogether. At the thought of persuading
him to do this, Mrs. Tate felt that at last
she had a definite task to perform; it was almost
like a mission, and the harder it proved
to be, the more exalted she would feel.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
After their return to the drawing-room,
Mrs. Tate, with a delightful feeling that she
was engaged in a conspiracy, made a mysterious
sign to Dr. Broughton to come to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose Percy's been whispering to
you not to have anything to do with this
scheme of mine, but don't pay any attention
to him. Do you know, I think the best
way would be to take the husband into the
library and have it out there. He must <i>be</i>
told, you know. He hasn't a suspicion of
it,&mdash;not a suspicion. You wait a few minutes,
and as soon as I get a chance, I'll ask
him to follow me out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Doctor smiled and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must take the responsibility,&quot; he
said carelessly. &quot;I shall merely do my
professional duty. Mr. Tate has just been
telling me about a curious idea&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't pay any attention to his ideas.
Percy thinks everything ought to be left to
regulate itself. A fine world it would be if
every one thought as he does. Now you go
back to him, and follow me when I tell you.
No, I have a better plan. You go into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
library with Percy. I'll come in there in a
few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A quarter of an hour later, when Mrs. Tate
entered the library with Jules, she found her
husband and the Doctor there, half-hidden
in a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This poor man, too, has been dying for
another cigar,&quot; she said; &quot;but he's too
polite to say so. So while he's smoking we
can have our talk. We'll take our coffee in
here, too. Percy, you go and see that
Madame Le Baron is properly served. I've
had to leave her there alone for a minute,
but I said I'd send you in. Dr. Broughton
and I are going to have a secret conference
with Monsieur Le Baron.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Secret conferences are always dangerous,&quot;
Tate replied, rising to leave the room. &quot;Look
out for them!&quot; he added with a smile to
Jules, as he hesitated at the door. When
he had closed the door behind him, he stood
in the hall a moment, thinking.</p>

<p class="indent">Tate was a man of sense, of &quot;horse-sense,&quot;
one of his friends used to say of him, and
not given to forebodings. Now, however,
he had a distinct regret that his wife was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
interfering in this matter, and fear of the
consequences. She often did things that he
disapproved, and he made no objection, for
he believed that she had as much right to
independence as himself; but in this case
he would have liked to interfere. He had
spoken to Dr. Broughton about his feeling
in the matter, and the Doctor had merely
laughed. Well, the Doctor knew better than
he did; perhaps, after all, his own theory was
absurd. At any rate, he could not be held
accountable for any trouble that might result
from his wife's meddling. This thought,
however, gave him little consolation. He
usually suffered for her mistakes much more
than she did herself.</p>

<p class="indent">When he went back to the drawing-room,
he had difficulty in sustaining a conversation
with Blanche; he kept thinking of the conference
in the next room, wondering what
the result would be. He was prepared to
see Jules enter with a pale face and set lips
and with wrath in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">When Jules finally entered between his
hostess and the Doctor, Tate scanned his face
narrowly; it was not white, and the lips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
were not set, but the whole expression had
changed to a look of dogged determination
and ill-concealed rage. He sat near his wife,
staring at her as if he had never seen her
before.</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments the conversation was
resumed, but the atmosphere seemed chilled.
Then the Doctor rose to say good-night, explaining
that he had promised to call on a
patient in Curzon Street before going home.
This seemed to be the signal for the breaking-up,
and all of the guests left at the same
moment, Mrs. Tate calling out to Blanche
at the door of the drawing-room that she
would look in on her the next day if she
were not too busy.</p>

<p class="indent">When the front door had closed, Tate
turned to his wife.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you had a stormy time of it, didn't
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She walked toward the centre of the drawing-room
and stood under the chandelier,
keeping her eyes fixed on her husband's face,
which seemed to be much more serious than
usual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What makes you think so?&quot; she asked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
removing a bracelet from her arm and nervously
twirling it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could tell from the expression in his
eyes, and from the way you and the Doctor
acted. He was furious, wasn't he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Furious? Le Baron? Hardly; though
I could see he didn't believe a word we
said. He was almost too startled to understand
it at first. The little goose hadn't
said a word to him about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what did he say when you told him
she ought to give up her performance? How
did he like that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn't like it at all, apparently. But
I didn't expect him to like it. It means
money out of his pocket.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it means more than that, if I'm not
mistaken.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What else can it mean?&quot; she said, lifting
her eyebrows questioningly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It means the end of whatever affection
he has for his wife. Of course he never had
much. A man of his sort doesn't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him with curiosity in her
face. &quot;What difference does her performing
make in his affection for her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
&quot;Can't you see that he didn't fall in love
with <i>her</i>? He fell in love with her performance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate put one finger to her lips and
hesitated for a moment. Then she said
slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How ridiculous you are, Percy! As if
any one ever heard of such a thing!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span></p>

<h2>XVI</h2>

<p class="indent">On the way home in the hansom that
he had called, Jules scarcely spoke.
Blanche kept glancing at him covertly; she
had never before seen that look in his face,
and it alarmed her; he seemed to be trying
to keep back the anger that showed itself in
his half-closed eyes and his firm-set chin.
When they reached the lodgings, Blanche
found Madeleine sound asleep by the fireplace,
and without waking her, she started
to go into the next room to see if Jeanne
were comfortable. When she reached the
door, Jules said in a low voice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait here a minute. I have something
to say to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the sound of the words, Madeleine's eyes
opened slowly, and she blinked at Jules, who
was glancing angrily at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is a pretty way you take care of
Jeanne. She might have had a dozen convulsions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
without your knowing anything about
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of Jules' command, the reference
to the convulsions, which had nearly cost
Jeanne her life a few weeks after birth, sent
Blanche agitatedly into the nursery. Madeleine
lumbered behind her, and both were
relieved to find the child sleeping contentedly
in her cradle, her cheeks flushed, and her
chubby hands clenched at her breast.
Blanche would have liked to pass several
moments there in rapt adoration, but Jules
appeared at the door and made a sign to her
to come to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madeleine will look out for her,&quot; he said,
pointing to the cradle. &quot;Go to bed,
Madeleine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche tiptoed out of the room, removed
her wraps, and, with the overcoat
Jules had thrown on the couch, hung them
in the little closet beside the big mirror.
Jules, who had taken a seat in front of the
fire-place, watched her impatiently, and
then motioned her to sit in the chair
opposite him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now perhaps you'll be kind enough to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
tell me what all this means. I knew that
Englishwoman would be up to some mischief.
What does it mean?&quot; he said sternly.</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche looked timidly into his face; the
expression of anger that she had noticed on
their way home was still there. She did not
know what to say, and tears of misery filled
her eyes and rolled slowly down her cheeks.
Then weakened by her previous outburst,
she covered her face with her hands, and
began to sob, giving expression to all the
torture that had come from the horror of
her performance, from her incessant terror
of being killed and separated from Jeanne.
Jules was at first touched, and then alarmed,
by the unexpected display of grief.</p>

<p class="indent">He waited, thinking that it would soon expend
itself; then when the sobs continued,
he went over to her, and taking her gently
in his arms, tried to soothe her by stroking
her hair and calling her by the endearing
names he had used during the first weeks of
their marriage, and begging her to control
herself for his sake, it hurt him so. After
this last appeal, Blanche put her arms round
his neck, and buried her head on his breast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
and for a few moments they sat together
without speaking, her body shaken now and
then from the violence of her grief. Then
Jules began to question her quietly, and the
whole story of her sufferings since Jeanne's
birth came out so pathetically that, in spite
of his anger, he was touched, and convinced
that, after all, the Englishwoman had been
right.</p>

<p class="indent">In his remorse that Blanche had suffered
in silence, and he had not found it out, had
done nothing to help her, he declared he
would have the diving stopped at once, no
matter what the cost might be. Rather than
see her unhappy, he would make her give
up performing altogether, if that were necessary.
At any rate, he would go to Marshall
the next day and see what could be done
about taking her name off the bills. They
would leave this disgusting London, perhaps
for the south of France, where Blanche could
have a long rest, and gather strength for her
visit to America the next year. For a long
time they talked over the plan, and then Jules
made Blanche go to bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll not be able to do your work tomorrow,&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
he said, &quot;if you sit up much longer.
Of course, you can't stop it at once. Marshall
wouldn't listen to that. You're his
best attraction, and he'll have to advertise
your last appearances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For more than an hour after Blanche left
him, Jules walked up and down the little
drawing-room, smoking cigarettes. The
revelation of his wife's trouble had so upset
him that he felt unable to sleep. But it was
of himself, not of her, that he was chiefly
thinking. Dr. Broughton had told him that
a long rest might cure Blanche of her nervous
terror and relieve her of the pains in
the back, but it was probable that she would
be affected again as soon as she resumed her
performance.</p>

<p class="indent">If this proved true, his own career would be
ruined; there would be no more travelling,
no more triumphs! Blanche would sink into
obscurity, would become a mere nonentity,
devoted to her child and house-keeping, like
scores of other wives and mothers that he
knew and despised in Paris. Out of the
circus, she was utterly commonplace, Jules
said to himself, and the fact came to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
with the force of a revelation! But for that
he would never have married her; the brilliancy
of her talent had dazzled him! And
now, if she had to leave the circus, how beautifully
he would have been tricked! He
would be tied down to her and her child!
The expense of maintaining them would
oblige him to live meanly, in a way that he
had never been used to, that he loathed.</p>

<p class="indent">What a fine trap he had got himself into!
There was absolutely no escape, unless
Blanche recovered from her ridiculous
cowardice. And all on account of that infant,
who had come into the world without
being wanted, and had spoiled his life!
For the moment Jules hated Jeanne. He
wished she had never been born, or had died
at birth; then all this trouble wouldn't have
occurred. But for Jeanne, Blanche might
have accepted that offer for a summer season
at Trouville. Then he wouldn't have
been bored at Boulogne, and Father Dumény
wouldn't have given him that letter to those
beasts of English.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jules' wrath turned from Jeanne to
Father Dumény, and on him he poured all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
his old bitterness against priests. They were
always interfering, those black-coated, oily-tongued
hypocrites. Oh, if he had Father
Dumény there! He would have liked to
choke him!</p>

<p class="indent">The more Jules thought, the more convinced
he became that his wife's nervousness
was due to imagination rather than to any
physical cause. Then, too, Blanche had been
homesick after her long stay in Boulogne,
where she saw her mother and her sisters
every day. What a fool he had been to
allow her to go there! He hated the whole
pack of them&mdash;Father Dumény, Madame
Berthier, her tiresome old husband, all!
What right did they have to interfere with
Blanche? She was his wife, she belonged to
him alone. When he reached this point
Jules had worked himself into a fine indignation;
but he had exhausted his cigarettes,
and it was now nearly twelve o'clock. Instead
of going to bed, however, he threw
himself on the couch in the corner of the
room, where a few hours later Blanche found
him, sleeping soundly.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules woke in an irritable mood, cross
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
with Madeleine, indifferent to Jeanne, with
whom he usually liked to gambol after breakfast,
and silent with his wife. For a time
he said nothing to Blanche about their talk
of the night before, and the expression of
his face prevented her from touching upon
it. Till eleven o'clock he was busily engaged
in writing letters; when he had
finished these, he turned to Blanche, who
was sitting alone by the table, making a
dress for Jeanne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've just written to Hicks in New York,&quot;
he said, &quot;the man who made me that fine
offer for next September. I told him we
couldn't sign the contract yet. That'll probably
make him offer us more money, and
it'll give you time to find out whether you
can go on with your work again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I shall surely go on with it,&quot; said
Blanche, hardly daring to look into his face.
&quot;I shall be well again after a rest. I know
I shall. The Doctor said&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind what the Doctor said. I
don't believe he knows anything about it.
You're just a little nervous, that's all. You
worry about little things too much, about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
Jeanne especially. Why can't you let Madeleine
take care of Jeanne? She knows a
good deal more about children than you do.
That's what we pay her for. The child
costs us enough, Heaven knows, and if your
salary's going to be cut off, we'll have to be
pretty economical.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Blanche said nothing; her
lips quivered, but she controlled herself.
Jules looked at her narrowly, and said to
himself that she was not half so pretty as she
had been; she was growing thinner, and
there were little lines in her face that ought
not to be in the face of one so young as her
mother said she was. How weak, how helpless
she seemed! Once the thought of her
weakness and ingenuousness had given him
pleasure; now it only made him realize his
own superiority.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; she suggested hesitatingly,&mdash;&quot;perhaps
Mr. Marshall might be willing to
make a new contract. Perhaps he would
let me go on with my performance on the
trapeze and the rope&mdash;without the dive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've thought of that,&quot; Jules replied, rising
and going to the closet for his overcoat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
&quot;But it isn't at all likely. He's been advertising
your dive all over London, and it's
been his best feature. He'll be pretty mad
when I tell him you're going to give it up.
He'll probably try to make me pay a forfeit
for breach of contract.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For breach of contract!&quot; she repeated
blankly. &quot;I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don't worry about it,&quot; said Jules,
with a pang of regret for the pain he had
caused her. &quot;I think I can make that all
right. I suppose that old Doctor would
write a certificate if I asked him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He drew on the fur-lined coat, and as he
took his gloves from his pocket he started
for the door, without kissing Blanche. Then,
at the door, glancing back, and seeing her
standing in the middle of the room with a
look of helpless pain in her face, he turned
and walked towards her, and bent his face
to hers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, there, dear, don't worry,&quot; he said.
&quot;You'll be all right again in a little while!&quot;
At the door he added: &quot;I shall be back in
an hour or two, and tell you what Marshall
says.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
The hour or two proved to be three hours,
and these Blanche passed chiefly in walking
up and down the apartment. She could not
keep still; she felt convinced that something
dreadful was going to happen. She hardly
dared even to talk to Jeanne, as if she
fancied the child might divine her misery.
She feared that she would be unable to
give up her performance, and she feared
she would have to go on with it. If she
did give it up, she had a presentiment that
she would pay dear for the release; if she
did not, she knew it would result in her
death.</p>

<p class="indent">Ever since coming to London, she had
prepared herself for the catastrophe. No
one, not even kind-hearted Mrs. Tate,
could imagine the agony of mind she had
endured. And it was all for Jeanne! Her
very sufferings had fed her love for the child.
If she and Jules could go away with Jeanne,
far away, where they would never hear or
think of performances again, how happy
they would be! But she must go on with
her work; she ought to fight against her
weakness. Jules had said she would grow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
strong again; she had always believed what
he said, and perhaps he was right now. Perhaps
after a rest she would want to go back
to the ring. But she was afraid, she was
afraid! Poor little Jeanne! Every few moments
she ran into the room where Jeanne
was taking her mid-day sleep. She wanted
to clasp the child to her breast and walk
up and down the room with her. But for
several weeks she had not dared to hold her
in her arms for fear of dropping her from
nervousness.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead of going directly to the Hippodrome,
Jules turned into Piccadilly, where he
had seen the sign of a French physician.
He had suddenly decided to seek further
medical advice before speaking to Marshall,
and he did not propose to trust Blanche's
case to another Englishman. He was obliged
to wait in Dr. Viaud's outer office for more
than an hour. The Doctor received him
with what seemed to Jules an almost suspicious
courtesy; but this disappeared as
soon as he explained that he was French.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules was gratified by the interest paid to
his repetition of Blanche's confession of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
night before. The Doctor did not interrupt
till Jules had mentioned the advice given by
the English physician.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Broughton!&quot; he exclaimed, repeating
the name after Jules. &quot;You couldn't have
consulted a better man. He's at the head
of his profession here in London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he had questioned Jules about
Blanche's symptoms, he said thoughtfully:
&quot;I cannot add anything to the advice Dr.
Broughton has given,&mdash;that is, of course,
with my present knowledge of the case. But
I have absolute confidence in his judgment.
The pains in the back I do not fear so much
as the terrible apprehension that you say
haunts your wife. In itself that is, of course,
great suffering; and the consequences may
be fatal. Your wife's dive requires iron
nerve, and that is being constantly weakened
by her continual worrying. I agree with
Dr. Broughton that she at least needs a rest
as soon as possible. There can't be two
opinions about that. But I should not like
to interfere with Dr. Broughton's&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules understood at once, and rose from
his seat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
&quot;I merely wanted to see what you thought.
If you had disagreed&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, but Dr. Broughton is very reliable!&quot;
said the Frenchman, with a smile and a shrug,
as if afraid of even a suggestion of professional
discourtesy.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules left him feeling bitterly disappointed.
There was no hope then! He had surmised
that the shrewd-eyed Englishman
knew his business. There was nothing to
do but to go to Marshall and explain the
situation.</p>

<p class="indent">When he returned from the Hippodrome
to the apartment Blanche met him at the door.
His face was darkened with a scowl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did he say?&quot; she asked nervously,
as he entered and threw his overcoat on
a chair. &quot;Was he&mdash;was he angry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Angry? No; he was altogether too
cool. If he'd been angry I shouldn't have
cared. I'd have liked that a good deal
better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then we sha'n't have to pay a forfeit?&quot;
said Blanche, glancing up into his face.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned away and threw himself wearily
on the couch. &quot;No, you won't have to pay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
a forfeit, but you'll have to go on with the
engagement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With the diving?&quot; she said, her face
growing white.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, with the other work&mdash;on the trapeze
and the rope. He said you'd have
to elaborate that, and he'd pay you half
what you're getting now till you were ready
to do the diving again. He wants to keep
you on account of your name. He's advertised
you all over the city, and even out
in the country places near London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he&mdash;he doesn't object to my giving
up the plunge?&quot; Blanche repeated, in a
tone which suggested that her professional
pride was hurt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn't when I told him the Doctor
had forbidden your going on with it for a
while. Besides, he had another reason for
not objecting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He showed me a letter he'd just had
from that woman who made such a sensation
in Bucharest while we were in Vienna.
Don't you remember? I showed you some
of her notices. She does a swimming act,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
and dives from a platform into a tank.
She's been playing in the English provinces,
and now she wants to come to London.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So he's going to engage her in my
place?&quot; Blanche gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In your place?&quot; Jules repeated irritably.
&quot;How can he engage her in your
place when he's going to keep you? We've
got to live, and it won't hurt you to go on
with your work on the trapeze and the rope.
He knows your name will be an attraction,
and if he engages that Englishwoman, she'll
be another card for him&mdash;a big one. He
says she's been drawing crowds in Manchester
for six weeks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's her name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;King&mdash;Lottie King&mdash;or something like
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she pretty? Did he show you her
pictures?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes; her manager sent him a whole box of
them. She's <i>petite</i>, with wicked little eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dark?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, blonde.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what is her dive?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
&quot;How high is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fifty feet, Marshall said; but one of the
circus hands told me it wasn't much more,
than forty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; There was a suggestion of a
sneer in her tone, and Jules looked up in
surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, it's nothing compared with
yours,&quot; he said, to console her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When is she going to begin?&quot; she
asked, after a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Going to begin? Do you mean here in
London? Marshall hasn't signed with her
yet. She's engaged in Manchester for three
weeks longer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall have to go on with my dive
till she comes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Jules replied coldly.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw that he did not wish to continue
the conversation; so she went into the
nursery, leaving him lying on the couch,
where he often took an afternoon nap;
since coming to London he had grown very
lazy, and had gained flesh. Blanche found
Jeanne wide awake and crowing in Madeleine's
arms. She sat beside the cradle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
and taking the child in her lap, sent Madeleine
out of the room. Jeanne snatched
at the brooch she wore at her throat, and
laughed into her face. Blanche tried to
smile in reply, but the tears welled into
her eyes again, and fell in big drops on
her cheeks.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span></p>

<h2>XVII</h2>

<p class="indent">Three days after Jules' talk with Marshall,
the forthcoming engagement at
the Hippodrome of Miss Lottie King was
announced in the London newspapers.
Blanche signed a new contract, by which
she agreed to perform for several weeks
longer on the trapeze and on the rope at
half the salary she had been receiving. Marshall
said that no mention of the plunge
would be made in the papers; her name
would continue to &quot;draw,&quot; and the public
would be satisfied with Miss King's great
dive into the tank. This remark made Jules
very angry, and it also depressed Blanche,
who felt as if she had already been deposed
from her supremacy as the chief attraction
at the Hippodrome. Indeed, as the time
drew near when she was to cease making
the plunge, instead of feeling happier, she
grew more despondent; she had already
elaborated her performance on the trapeze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
by introducing several new feats that she
and Jules had planned together, but with
these she was not satisfied; she felt like an
actor obliged to play small parts after winning
success in leading characters.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Jules, he did not try to hide his
discontent at the change in his wife's work.
In the first place, it made his brief but dramatic
public appearance unnecessary; in
future he would be obliged to conduct
Blanche to the circus, and live again like
any mere hanger-on to the skirts of a public
performer. The <i>rôle</i> was ignoble, unworthy
of him. Then, too, he chafed at the
thought of his wife's decline in importance
at the Hippodrome; he fancied that when
her inability to go on with the plunge had
become known to the other performers they
would lose respect for her and for himself.</p>

<p class="indent">He secretly doubted if the public would
accept Blanche merely for her performance
on the trapeze and on the rope. Almost
any one could do that; but in the plunge she
was without a rival. He hoped that, as a
compensation for his vexation, the performance
of Miss King would be a failure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
Forty feet! What did that amount to in
comparison with the magnificent plunge of
more than ninety feet that Blanche had
made at Vienna?</p>

<p class="indent">Already Jules had begun to think of his
wife in the past tense chiefly, as if she lived
in the triumphs she had made by her nightly
flight through the air. Indeed, she seemed
to him almost another person now. Instead
of looking on her almost with reverence, as
he had done, he felt sorry for her, as if she
were his inferior; and though he continued
to treat her with kindness, there was a suggestion
of pity, almost of contempt, in his
manner toward her. She sought consolation
in her child, who, she thought, grew stronger
and more beautiful every day. For Jeanne's
sake she tried to be glad the time was so
near when she should give up risking her
life; but the nearer it grew, the more depressed
she became, and the more she
thought about that woman who was to take
her place.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate, who had definitely taken
Blanche under her protection, and called
at the little hotel several times each week,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
had been delighted at what she considered
the fortunate solution of a shocking difficulty.
Now that Blanche was to stop making
that horrible dive, there was no reason
why she shouldn't be the happiest woman
in the world. With her keen instinct, however,
she observed that Blanche was not
happy; she wondered, too, at the frequent
absence of the husband from this <i>ménage</i>.
Jules couldn't be very devoted, she thought,
for a man who had been married little more
than a year. Perhaps, however, he avoided
her; for, in spite of his French politeness,
he had not been able to conceal his dislike
for her. For this reason she did not ask
him to dinner again. She often took Blanche
and Jeanne to drive in the afternoon, and
pointed out the celebrities that they passed
in the Park.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My husband says I take you to drive
just to show you off,&quot; she said jokingly
one day. &quot;He thinks I have a mania for
celebrities.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, but I'm not a celebrity!&quot; Blanche
replied, with a smile that was almost sad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a celebrity? Of course you are. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
haven't a doubt that half the people we meet
recognize you. You know, it's been quite
the fashion to go to the Hippodrome this
year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I sha'n't be a celebrity much longer,&quot;
said Blanche, glancing at the bare boughs of
the trees, and wondering if any other place
could be as desolate as London in winter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? You don't think of retiring
into private life altogether, do you?&quot; Mrs.
Tate laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, but I shall only be an ordinary performer
after this week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I'd rather be an ordinary performer
and keep my neck whole than be an <i>ex</i>traordinary
one and risk my life every night,&quot;
Mrs. Tate retorted sharply. She was vexed
with Blanche for not appreciating her emancipation.</p>

<p class="indent">They rode on in silence for a few moments.
Then Blanche said,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's some one going to take my
place, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some one that's going to make that
dreadful plunge?&quot; Mrs. Tate cried in horror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, not that. She jumps into a tank of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
water&mdash;from a platform&mdash;only about forty
feet. My jump is more than seventy-five
feet,&quot; Blanche added with a touch of pride.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate rested her hands in her lap and
burst out laughing. &quot;What a ridiculous
thing! I beg your pardon, dear, but I can't
help being amused. Of course it doesn't
seem funny to you. You're used to it; but
it does to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she questioned Blanche about the
new performer, and Blanche repeated what
Jules had told her and what she had since
heard of the woman at the Hippodrome.
Mrs. Tate was greatly interested, and laughed
immoderately; afterward, however, when she
had returned home and thought over the conversation,
she regarded it more seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think, Percy?&quot; she said at
the dinner table that night. &quot;Those Hippodrome
people have engaged a creature to
dive into a tank of water from a platform.
Of course, that's to take the place of Madame
Le Baron's plunge. Could anything be more
absurd? The worst of it is that the poor
little woman is frightfully jealous already. I
could see that from the way she talked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
What a dreadful world it is, isn't it? They're
all like that, aren't they, even the best of
them? Do you remember that poor Madame
Gardini who sang here one night? She told
me if she had her life to live over again she'd
never dream of going on the stage. She said
opera-singers were the unhappiest people in
the world,&mdash;just poisoned with jealousy.
And these circus people are exactly like
them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What makes you think she's jealous?
What was it she said?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn't <i>what</i> she said, it was the <i>way</i>
she talked about the woman. Her husband
says she's a great beauty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, the husband says so, does he?&quot; Tate
remarked dryly. A moment later he added:
&quot;I wish you hadn't had anything to do with
those people!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You've said that a dozen times, Percy,
and I wish you'd stop. For my part, I'm
very glad I've met them. If I hadn't, that
poor little creature would be in her grave
before the end of a year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps she'll wish that she <i>were</i> in her
grave before the end of the year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing, dear, nothing. Don't catch
at everything I say. How is she now&mdash;any
better? I suppose she's easier in
mind now that she's going to stop that
diving?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's the strangest thing about it,&quot; Mrs.
Tate answered, with a change of tone. &quot;I
thought she would be, too, but she isn't.
I really believe she's sorry she's giving
it up. But perhaps that's because she's
been doing it all her life. She'll miss it
at first&mdash;even if it did worry her nearly to
death!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has Dr. Broughton been to see her
lately?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; he said it wouldn't be necessary.
He's going to wait to see what effect the rest
from the diving will have on her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments Tate looked thoughtfully
at his wife. &quot;Upon my word,&quot; he said,
&quot;I half suspect that you <i>want</i> something
to happen to that little woman. It would
just be romantic enough to suit you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Percy, how can you talk so? You're
simply brutal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
&quot;She might at least break a leg to please
you,&quot; her husband laughed, &quot;before giving
up that plunge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche made her last dive without the
accident that Tate had regarded as indispensable
to dramatic effect. Indeed, since
knowing that she was to give it up, she
seemed to have lost much of her terror of
the plunge; she thought of it now chiefly with
regret. That night, as she rode home with
Jules and Madeleine, she seemed depressed;
Jules, too, was even more sullen than he had
been for the past two weeks. When they
had entered the lodgings and were eating
their midnight meal, she said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If to-morrow is pleasant we might take
Jeanne for a drive in the country. The air
would do her good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't go,&quot; he replied indifferently. &quot;I
have something else to do. Besides, it would
cost too much. We shall have to be economical
now that you're going to be on half-salary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The next morning Jules left the hotel at
eleven o'clock, saying that he shouldn't be
back for luncheon. He did not explain where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
he was going, and Blanche did not question
him. She busied herself with Jeanne, and
this distracted her till Jeanne fell sound
asleep. Then she became a prey to her
old melancholy, and for an hour she walked
up and down the room, to the bewilderment
of Madeleine, who could not understand
what the matter was.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is Madame suffering with the pain in her
back?&quot; Madeleine asked at last.</p>

<p class="indent">No, Madame was not suffering. She had
not been troubled by the pain for several
days; she hoped it would leave her for
good now that she had stopped taking the
plunge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, God be praised that you do that no
longer!&quot; Madeleine cried, lifting her withered
hands to heaven and rolling her eyes. &quot;It
was too terrible. Since that first night in
Paris, when I went with you and Monsieur
Jules, I never dared to look. It was <i>affreux</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Jules loved it,&quot; said Blanche, throwing
herself into a chair beside the old woman.</p>

<p class="indent">Ah, yes, Madeleine acknowledged. He
used to rave about it in the little flat in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
<i>rue de Lisbonne</i>. Once Madeleine heard him
talking in his sleep about the circus and the
wonderful dive; he always slept with his door
wide-open, and she often heard him talking
away like one wide-awake. He had told
her that it was the most wonderful thing he
had ever seen, and no other woman in the
world would have dared to do it. Madeleine
was always delighted to have a chance to talk
about Jules, and she babbled on, never suspecting
that her words were making Blanche
suffer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think,&quot; Blanche said at last,
&quot;do you think he would have loved me if
I hadn't done that&mdash;if I hadn't done that
plunge, I mean&mdash;in the Circus?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine glanced at her quickly; she
was unable to grasp the significance of the
question. &quot;But he did see you in the Circus,&quot;
she replied. &quot;If he hadn't seen you
there, <i>chérie</i>, he wouldn't have seen you
at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes, that's true.&quot; Blanche realized
that it would be useless to try to explain
what she meant. Then, after a moment,
she added, &quot;And now that I've given up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
dive,&mdash;perhaps I shall never be able to do
it again; the Doctor said I might not,&mdash;now
that I've given it up, do you think he'll
love me just the same?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine's faded eyes turned to Blanche
and examined her closely. &quot;If he'll love
you just the same?&quot; she repeated. &quot;What
has put such a strange idea into your head,
child? Of course he'll love you just the
same.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Madeleine was launched on a flood
of eulogy. Jules was so good, so faithful, so
affectionate. There was not another like
him. He had always been so tender with
his mother; and oh, how his poor mother
had worshipped him! Madeleine's praises
had the effect of soothing Blanche for a
time; they also made her ashamed of the
half-conscious suspicion which had arisen
in her mind, and which she would not have
dared to formulate even to herself. She only
permitted herself to acknowledge that his
present manner toward her was different
from his old one. She was also disturbed
by his refusal for the past three Sundays to
go to church with her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
The next afternoon Jules came home
in a rage. &quot;I've been down to see Marshall,&quot;
he said. &quot;What do you suppose the
old fool's gone and done? He had the
door of your dressing-room opened this
morning and all your things turned out into
Miss Van Pelt's old room,&mdash;the little hole
next door, you know. It's hardly big
enough to breathe in. He said you weren't
the star any longer, and he must give the
room to Miss King. It seems she's a kicker
and he's afraid of a row.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche had nothing to say in reply; this
seemed to her only another indignity added
to those she had already suffered. The worst
was to come in the evening, when her rival
would share the applause that used to be hers.
A few moments later she asked,&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was she there&mdash;that woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; she hasn't appeared yet, and Marshall
was a little nervous. She was to come
up from Manchester in a train that got in
during the afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But suppose she doesn't come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she'll come fast enough. Marshall
had a telegram saying she'd started. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
big iron tub arrived this morning. They
were putting it in the ground and laying the
pipes for the water when I was there. They
keep it covered till her act begins.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does she do besides her jump?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Marshall says she goes through a
lot of antics, stays under the water till she
nearly dies of suffocation, and cooks a meal,
and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Under water?&quot; Blanche gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, of course not, you ninny,&quot; Jules
cried impatiently. His wife's simplicity had
long before ceased to amuse him. &quot;She
does it while she's floating. Then one of
the circus boys falls into the tank, and she
shows how she used to rescue people out in
California.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then she's an American.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's lived in America all her life, but
her father was an Englishman, and she was
born in England. Her father kept a swimming
school out in San Francisco; that's
how she got into the business. They say
she's got a lot of medals for saving lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As Jules walked into the next room to
change his clothes for the evening, he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
to himself that his wife was growing very
stupid and tiresome.</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche sat alone for a few moments, feeling
cold and forlorn. She could not keep
from thinking and wondering about that
woman; she was anxious and yet afraid to
see her. She could not account for the dislike
and terror with which the mere thought
of the woman inspired her. She had never
before regarded the other performers in the
circus as her rivals; so, for the first time in
her life, she knew the bitterness of jealousy.</p>

<p class="indent">Before preparing for the evening she went
into the nursery, and for several moments sat
beside the cradle where Jeanne was peacefully
sleeping, her little face rosy with health.
The poor child, she thought, could never
know the sacrifice she had made for her.
She was glad she had made it; she had
done her duty; but it was hard, it was so
hard! Then she bent over and kissed
Jeanne on the cheek; the child drew her
head away, and buried her face impatiently
in the pillow. Blanche turned her gently in
the crib, adjusted the lace covering, and
stole out of the room.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
Jules met her as she was closing the door
softly behind her. &quot;What have you been
doing in there?&quot; he cried petulantly. &quot;Why
can't you let Jeanne alone when she's asleep?
Every time she takes a nap you go in and
wake her up. No wonder&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven't waked her,&quot; Blanche replied
apologetically. &quot;I only went in to see if she
needed anything, and I sat beside her a
moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you'll spoil her if you keep on.
From the way you act one would imagine
that Jeanne was the only creature in the
world worth thinking about!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They both took their places at the table
which Madeleine had prepared, and proceeded
silently with their dinner. Madeleine,
who hovered about them, wondered
what the matter was; she had never seen
Monsieur Jules like this before; he usually
had a great deal to say. When she had left
the room for a few minutes, Jules looked up
from his plate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've been wondering whether we ought
to keep Madeleine or not. She's a great
expense. We could get along just as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
without her. The <i>garçon</i> could serve our
meals. We have to pay for the service
whether we get it or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When he had spoken he was startled by
the look in his wife's face. Not keep Madeleine!
The mere thought of parting with
the old woman, whom she had come to
regard almost as a second mother, shocked
her so much that for a moment she could
not formulate a reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we couldn't get along without her!&quot;
she said. &quot;Think of all she does for me
and for Jeanne!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Jeanne! It's always Jeanne, Jeanne.
I'm sick of hearing her name. If Jeanne
hadn't been born we shouldn't be in the
pretty box we're in now, and you'd be going
on with your work like a sensible woman.
I tell you we must economize. We're under
heavy expenses here, and we're going to lose
a lot of money by this imaginary sickness of
yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't let Madeleine go,&quot; Blanche replied.
&quot;I should die without her. I should
die of loneliness. And she loves you so, as
much as if you were her son, and she loved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
your mother. She has often talked to me
about her. I can't, I can't let her go. I'd
rather&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, then. Don't say anything
more about it. We'll have to economize
in some other way. Here she comes now.
So keep quiet, or she'll want to find out
what we've been talking about.&quot;</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>

<p class="indent">The Hippodrome was crowded on the
night of Miss King's first appearance.
Jules, in evening dress as usual, leaned against
the railing behind the highest tier of seats.
At this moment he felt that he had been
duped by fate, and he wanted to revenge
himself on the crowd that had come to rejoice
over his disappointment; for their presence
seemed like a personal insult to him.
But for the machinations of that crazy Englishwoman,
Blanche would now be going on
with her work; by this time they might have
made arrangements for her visit to America
in the early summer. However, the mischief
was done, and there was no knowing when it
would be undone. Blanche might have recovered
in a few weeks from her terror of
the plunge; but after once yielding to it, she
would probably never get over it.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules believed in presentiments, and he
had a strong presentiment that Blanche had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
taken her plunge for the last time. He tried
to console himself, however, with the hope
that Lottie King would make a failure. The
extensive advertising that Marshall had given
her made Jules hate the girl; her name had
been posted in places all over London where
his wife's alone had been. To Jules this
was the most cruel evidence of his own
decadence.</p>

<p class="indent">Half an hour before it was time for Blanche
to appear Jules sauntered toward her dressing-room.
When he reached the door, he
stopped in surprise; he could hear an unfamiliar
voice speaking English. Some one
must be in there with Blanche and Madeleine.
When he entered, he saw a plump,
pretty young woman, with a shock of yellow
hair and big blue eyes, dressed in a tight-fitting
bathing-suit of blue flannel and in
blue silk stockings. He recognized her at
once from her photographs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hello!&quot; she cried, glancing at Jules
familiarly. &quot;Is this him? Introduce me,
won't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Blanche, whose face had
been made up and whose figure, dressed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
white silk tights, was covered with the cloak
she threw off as she entered the ring, looked
confused. Then she presented Jules to Miss
King, who beamed upon him with extravagant
pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your wife's been telling me about you,&quot;
she said. &quot;I've been making friends with
her. I wanted to see what she was like, and
I supposed she'd want to see what I was
like. So we've agreed not to scratch each
other's eyes out. You speak English too,
don't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This gave Jules an opportunity to reiterate
his story about having learned English
in America.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you've been to America!&quot; Miss King
cried, her eyes bigger than ever, and her
open mouth showing her white, square teeth.
&quot;Were you with a troupe there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules shook his head. &quot;I wasn't married
then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; The diver glanced sharply at
Blanche, and then back at Jules, as if making
a rapid calculation of their ages. &quot;Been
married long?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A little over a year,&quot; Blanche replied.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
&quot;Too bad your wife had to give her dive
up, ain't it?&quot; the girl said to Jules. &quot;I hear
it was great. But I suppose you'll do it
again, won't you, when you're better?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche flushed. &quot;I don't know,&quot; she
said, with a half-frightened look at Jules.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I would if I was you. It's sensational
things like that that ketches 'em. My
act's kind of sensational, but it ain't in it with
yours for cold nerve an' grit. When you do
it again you'd oughter go to America. You
can make a good deal more there than you
do here. I came over just for the reputation.
It helps you a lot over there if you've
made a hit in Europe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you are English, aren't you?&quot; Jules
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, I s'pose I am, in a sort of way.
I was born over here, but my father took me
to America when I was about six, an' I'm
American to the backbone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you been in the ring long?&quot;
Blanche asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I only took to giving performances
about five years ago; but I've been in the
swimming business all my life. My Dad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
had a swimming school out in 'Frisco; but
there's more money in this business. But I
guess I'm keeping you folks. It must be
most time for your act. Good-bye. P'raps
I'll see you later. I'm mighty glad you
can speak English,&quot; she laughed, with a
glance at Jules. &quot;I travelled with a troupe
once with a lot of Italians in it, and my,
what a time I had tryin' to talk with 'em!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She hurried out, leaving Jules with a vision
of tousled yellow hair, a roguish smile, and
gleaming white teeth, and with the sound of
a rich contralto voice in his ears. As soon
as the door closed, he turned to Blanche.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did she happen to come in here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She wanted me to help her with one of
her slippers that was torn. Madeleine sewed
it up for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hasn't she got any maid?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She left her behind in Manchester. She
was sick. She's coming on when she gets
better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules merely grunted and walked out of
the room. The sound of the contralto voice
was still in his ears. What a sweet voice it
was! She seemed to him just like an American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
in spite of her birth, and Jules preferred
the Americans to the English. He wondered
what her performance was like, and
he waited impatiently for Blanche to finish
her act on the trapeze and the rope. As
his eyes followed Blanche, he kept seeing
the tousled hair and the broad smile revealing
the white teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">It took several moments for the tank to
be arranged for the crowning performance.
The audience waited in good-natured patience,
however, and when finally the plump
little figure in blue flannel ran out, there was
a round of applause. Lottie King had added
a touch of rouge to either cheek, and she
looked very pretty as she ran up the flight
of steps leading to the edge of the tank,
poised there for a moment with the fingers
of both hands touching high in the air, and
then dived in a graceful curve into the water.
She speedily reappeared, shaking her head
and laughing, and struck out for the rope
that hung from the platform. This she
climbed hand over hand, the water dripping
from her figure, and glistening on her
face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
Jules, whose eyes had been eagerly following
her, was surprised to see that she was
going to begin her act with the dive, instead
of keeping it for the climax. She seemed to
take it very coolly, he thought, as she stood
on the swaying platform, rubbing her face
with a handkerchief and rearranging one of
the sleeves of her costume. Then she steadied
the platform, and, an instant later, she
was cutting, feet foremost, through the air,
her arms by her side and her body rigid.
When she reached the water, there was very
little splashing, and she speedily reappeared,
shaking her head again and displaying her
white teeth.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules had watched the dive breathlessly,
Just as he had watched Blanche's on the night
when he first saw her in the <i>Cirque Parisien</i>,
and now he followed her feats of skill and
strength with wonder and fascination. When
she remained beneath the surface for more
than three minutes he felt as if he himself
were stifling, and when she reappeared,
calm and smiling, he took a long breath.</p>

<p class="indent">He supposed that the rescue of one of the
circus hands who fell opportunely into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
tank would end the performance; but instead
of leaving the ring, Lottie King climbed
again to the platform. Surely, Jules thought,
she would make a mistake if she repeated
that plunge. Instead, however, she swung
on the edge, leaped backward into the air,
and after several swift turns, fell with a
crash into the water. As she swam to the
ladder, the band burst into triumphant music,
and the audience cheered, and began to
climb down from the circular seats and to
rush to the spot where she was to make
her exit.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jules roused himself. He felt as if
he had been in a dream. He had difficulty
in reaching Blanche's dressing-room, for the
crowd had gathered at the entrance to the
ring in order to catch another glimpse of the
dripping figure of the diver. When finally
he succeeded in making his way there, he
found Blanche sitting motionless, her arms
resting on the table. He at once divined
the cause of her dejection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see what you've brought on yourself,&quot;
he said. &quot;A lot you'll amount to now!
You might as well give up the business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
Madeleine looked at him with mild reproach
in her eyes. He paid no attention
to her, however. He walked back to the
door, and turning, he added: &quot;But you
can't stay here all night. I thought you'd
be dressed by this time. I'll wait out here
for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules looked anxiously up and down the
corridor, but he saw no one. He could hear
the noise of the crowd slowly wending out of
the Hippodrome, and from the dressing-rooms
on either side the buzz of voices.
Miss King must have succeeded in making
her escape to her room.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span></p>

<h2>XIX</h2>

<p class="indent">If Jules had tried, he would have been
unable to explain the fascination that
Lottie King's performance had for him. In
daring it was greatly inferior to his wife's
plunge; but the fact that Blanche had lost
courage lent her rival's serene indifference
to danger an added attractiveness for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Every night he watched her with more
delight. Besides being plucky and skilful,
she was so pretty and so amusing! Jules
liked to talk with her in the evening before
she made her appearance, and she used to
convulse him with laughter by her sallies.
She soon fell into the habit of running
into Blanche's room to ask Madeleine to
do services for her, and toward Blanche she
adopted a manner of half-amused patronage.
By the end of the first week, Blanche had
conceived a great dislike for her. This
might have been at least partly due to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
discovery of the pleasure which Jules took in
the diver's society.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate had expected that, after ceasing
to make her plunge, Blanche would improve
in health; but she speedily saw that she was
mistaken. One afternoon she called at the
hotel in Albemarle Street and found Blanche
alone with the little Jeanne; Madeleine had
just gone out to do some errands. They had
a long talk, during which Blanche was obliged
to confess that the pain in her back troubled
her just as much as ever, and that she was
very unhappy. When Mrs. Tate tried to
find out why she was unhappy, she could
elicit no satisfactory explanation. As soon
as she arrived home that night, she repeated
the conversation to her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you suppose the little creature can
be mercenary, Percy?&quot; she said. &quot;Do you
think she can be sorry she isn't risking her
neck every day? I wanted to tell her this
morning she ought to be ashamed of herself&mdash;she
ought to think of her child. Suppose
she had been killed! What would have become
of the child, <i>I'd</i> like to know!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That other person has made a hit, I see.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
They're booming her in the papers. Did
she speak of her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a word!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H'm!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean by that, Percy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you think she's jealous of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jealous?&quot; Tate repeated, lifting his
eyes. &quot;You told me yourself that she was
jealous before she even saw the other
performer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and now she's jealous of her
success.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, <i>professional</i> jealousy,&quot; he said,
throwing back his head. A moment later
he added: &quot;There are worse kinds of
jealousy than that in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate looked at him closely, but his
eyes were fixed on his plate. For a few
moments they did not speak; she was pondering
his last remark. They understood
each other so well that they often divined
each other's thoughts. Now she saw that he
did not care to discuss the subject, and she
let it drop. She continued to think about it
so much, however, that she determined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
go to the Hippodrome alone some day, to a
<i>matinée</i>, and see for herself what Blanche's
successor as a star performer was like.</p>

<p class="indent">She returned home with a sickly feeling of
regret and torturing anticipation; she had
not only seen Lottie King, but she had also
studied the face of Jules Le Baron, who,
unconscious of her gaze, stood within a few
yards of her seat. What she had observed
in his expression, however, she did not communicate
to her husband.</p>

<p class="indent">Her visit at the Hippodrome made her
resolve to be even kinder to Blanche than
she had been; she would take her and the
child to drive in the Park two or three times
a week,&mdash;oftener if she could. Mrs. Tate
tried to shake off her forebodings, but for
the rest of the day they clung to her, and
the next morning she woke with them fresh
in mind. So she resolved to drive at once
to Albemarle Street. The weather was too
dull to take the child out, and she would
pass the morning with Blanche and try to
cheer her up.</p>

<p class="indent">When she reached the hotel she felt
relieved to find Blanche in a much better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
frame of mind than she had been on the
occasion of her last call. The pain had left
her for a few days, Blanche explained, and
she had been greatly encouraged; even Jules
had spoken of her improvement; he had
been so patient with her, and now she felt
ashamed of having been so dispirited. Mrs.
Tate went away with a feeling that she
had been a fool, that her forebodings were
ridiculous.</p>

<p class="indent">One night at the end of the week, Tate
returned home with the announcement that
he was to start for Berlin the next day, to
confer with the heads of a banking-house
there with regard to the floating of a great
loan. He gave her the choice of staying
at home or of starting with him after only
a few hours of preparation. She chose to
start, and for two months she did not see
London again; for, once away from the
routine of his work, Tate took advantage of
the opportunity to run for a holiday from
Berlin down to Dresden, and thence over
to Paris. During this time Mrs. Tate forgot
her self-imposed cares, and gave herself up
to the pleasures of travelling.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
When she returned home, she was surprised
to hear that Madame Le Baron had
called several times, and had left word that
she was anxious to see her as soon as she
came back. This news sent her with a
throbbing heart to Albemarle Street; she
felt sure that something terrible had happened,
something she might have prevented
by staying in London. She was always assuming
responsibilities and then dropping
them! How often her husband had told
her that! She had been more than culpable,
she kept saying to herself, in going away
without even bidding Blanche good-bye,
without even leaving an address.</p>

<p class="indent">When she arrived at the hotel, at the
close of a cold, foggy afternoon, she was surprised
to be told by the <i>garçon</i> that Madame
Le Baron had left, and had gone to an
apartment in Upper Bedford Place. &quot;It
was too expensive for them here,&quot; the <i>garçon</i>
explained with a contemptuous grin.
&quot;So they went to a private house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate drove at once to the number
the boy gave her, and a few moments later
she was climbing the stairs to Blanche's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
apartment. She was out of breath when she
rapped on the door, and still breathing hard
when Madeleine admitted her into the shabby
drawing-room. A moment later, as Blanche
appeared from the next room, she uttered an
exclamation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good Heavens, child, what has happened
to you! You're whiter than ever, and so
<i>thin</i>! What have you been doing to yourself?
Have you had an illness?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche shook her head. &quot;No, I haven't
been ill,&quot; she replied, but her looks and
her manner seemed to belie her words.
The gray cloth dress which had once
fitted her tightly now hung loosely about
her; her face was drawn and of a chalklike
pallor, and under the eyes were two
black lines betraying weeks of suffering and
sleeplessness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were thin enough before I went
away,&quot; said Mrs. Tate, &quot;but now you're a
perfect spectre.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she went on to explain how she had
happened to desert her friends for so long a
time. &quot;I know you have something to tell
me,&quot; she said, starting from her seat, &quot;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
before you begin I want to see Jeanne. How
is she? But first tell me how you happened
to come way up here. Isn't it a long distance
for you to climb after your performance
every night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jules chose these rooms because they
were so much cheaper than the hotel,&quot;
Blanche replied simply. &quot;We prepare our
own meals, too, and we save in that way.
You know my salary is so much smaller than
it used to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate made no comment, and they
went into the other room, where Jeanne was
sleeping in the crib.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She sleeps nearly all the time,&quot; said
Blanche, with a faint smile that seemed to
exaggerate the expression of pain and weariness
in her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How big she's growing!&quot; Mrs. Tate
whispered. &quot;There's certainly nothing the
matter with <i>her</i>, the dear little thing, with
her fat rosy cheeks. I'd just like to take
her in my arms and hug her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For several minutes they stood talking
about the child; then they left her with
Madeleine and went back to the drawing-room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
which Mrs. Tate's keen eyes discovered
was used also as a bedroom. &quot;They
must be economizing with a vengeance,&quot;
she thought. Blanche closed the door, and
took a seat behind her visitor on the couch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I want to hear all about it,&quot; Mrs.
Tate cried. &quot;Something has happened.
What is it?&quot; She took both of Blanche's
hands and looked into her eyes. &quot;What is
it?&quot; she repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment they sat looking at each
other. Then Blanche bent forward, buried
her head on Mrs. Tate's lap, and burst into
tears. Mrs. Tate said nothing, and allowed
the paroxysm to spend itself. Then, gradually,
the story came out.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules didn't love her any more, Blanche
moaned. He had been cruel to her, oh, so
cruel; he had said such dreadful things!
And then there had been days and days
when he scarcely spoke to her or to the little
Jeanne or to Madeleine, and he had
grown so strict with them all; he hardly
allowed Madeleine enough to buy the things
they needed. And once, he had said such
dreadful things about Jeanne. He didn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
love even Jeanne any more,&mdash;poor little
Jeanne! He said they would have been
better off if she had never been born. Oh,
that had nearly killed her, that he should
have spoken so about Jeanne. She didn't
care so much about herself, though sometimes
she wanted to die. One night she
had prayed that God would take her and
Jeanne together. Jules had always been so
good to her until&mdash;until that woman came,
that woman who had taken her place in the
circus. It was that woman who had come
between them, with her white teeth and
her mocking laugh. She was making a fool
of Jules; she did not care for him, but she
pretended that she did, just to amuse herself.
Jules followed her about everywhere;
he even talked of going to America, because
she was to go in a few weeks, when her engagement
at the Hippodrome was over. But
Blanche would die; she would throw herself
into the river with Jeanne in her arms rather
than go there now. Ah, it had been so hard
for her, alone in a strange country, with no
one but Madeleine to confide in. Madeleine
had been so good; but she, too, had grown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
afraid of Jules in these last weeks. They
scarcely dared to speak when he was at
home, now.</p>

<p class="indent">From broken utterances, Mrs. Tate pieced
together the whole miserable story. For the
moment, her pity was lost in admiration for
her husband's perspicacity. He had foreseen
this! Now, for the first time, she realized
what she had vaguely surmised before,
the full meaning of his mysterious remark
about Blanche and Jules. Then she turned
her attention to the prostrate figure before
her, offering sympathy and counsel. She
knew that she was speaking in platitudes,
but they were all she could offer then; and,
after all, it was Blanche's own outburst that
would do the poor pent-up creature the
most good, the consciousness that she had
some one to confide in.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate stayed in the little apartment a
long time, and when she went away, Blanche
seemed to feel more hopeful. &quot;Act as if
he were just as kind to you as ever,&quot; was
her parting injunction, &quot;and I know everything
will come out all right. He'll find
out that that dreadful woman is only making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
a fool of him, and then he'll care more for
you than ever.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In her heart, however, Mrs. Tate knew
that what she said was not true. Jules had
probably grown tired of his wife. The more
she thought of the case, the more she pitied
Blanche,&mdash;the more she realized what a
tragedy in the poor little woman's life it
meant. And she really had been to blame,
she kept saying to herself. But for her interference,
Blanche would have gone on with
her diving, that other performer would not
have come to the Hippodrome, and all of
Blanche's agony of jealousy and neglect
would have been avoided.</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, what a lesson it taught her! Never,
<i>never</i> would she interfere in a family again!
She would have done much better to let
Blanche go to her death, rather than to
drive her to despair, perhaps to a worse
form of death by her meddling.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching home, she was in a fever of
remorse and sympathy, and she passed a
miserable hour waiting for her husband to
return. When at last he did appear, she
met him in the hall.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
&quot;Percy,&quot; she cried dramatically, &quot;you're
a prophet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I, indeed?&quot; he said, putting his
umbrella in the rack. &quot;Do you mean to
say this is the first time you've found it
out?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll never doubt your word again, Percy,&quot;
she went on, stifling a sob. Her appeal to
her husband for sympathy threatened to
make her hysterical, but she controlled herself
and gasped out: &quot;Don't you remember
what you said about that man, Le Baron,&mdash;you
know, the night he dined here, about
his falling in love with his wife's performance!
Well, that's just what he did do.
He didn't fall in love with <i>her</i>; he's never
<i>been</i> in love with her, poor thing. Fortunately
she doesn't know that. It's only her
<i>performance</i>, that horrible plunge she used
to make, that he's been in love with all
along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't see anything very prophetic
about that,&quot; he said, walking into the drawing-room,
where she followed him, clutching
at the lace handkerchief in her hand. &quot;It
was as plain as daylight to any one that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
heard him talk and saw what kind of man
he was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't mean your seeing merely that.
I could tell from what you said that you
saw a great deal more. Don't you remember
what you said about <i>professional</i> jealousy
not being the worst kind of jealousy in the
world? That was the first thing that opened
my eyes. I went to the next <i>matinée</i> to see for
myself if it could be true, and if I hadn't
been an idiot I should have realized it all
then. But the next day, just before we left
for Berlin, I called on that poor woman, and
she seemed so much easier in mind, I thought
I must have misunderstood what you meant
and been mistaken about that look.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear, I don't quite follow you. Aren't
you just a little bit illogical?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I'm not. I'm perfectly logical.
I never was more logical in my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose you mean that the fellow has
got tired of his wife, now that she's given
up her dive, and he's fallen in love with
the other woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate rose tragically from her chair
and made a sweeping gesture with her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
right hand. &quot;With the other woman's
<i>performance</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tate looked at her for a moment, with
smiling incredulity. &quot;How ridiculous!&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's exactly what I said when you
told me he had fallen in love with his <i>wife's</i>
performance. I said it was the most ridiculous
thing I'd ever heard in my <i>life</i>. I
couldn't have believed it if I hadn't observed
it with my own eyes. But that afternoon
I saw him&mdash;he stood near me, leaning
against the railing&mdash;and I wish you could
have seen the expression in his face while
that woman was exhibiting herself, especially
when she made her horrible dives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Tate stood without speaking.
Then he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm afraid you're putting a romantic
interpretation on a very simple sequence of
events. That fellow probably did fall in
love with his wife's performance, and incidentally
he liked the money that went with
it. When she stopped her diving and became
an ordinary performer, like thousands
of others, she ceased to interest him. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
he looked around for some one else to be
interested in, and when the other acrobatic
person appeared he was just in the condition
to be caught.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe it. It's a&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's one way, of course, of proving
whether you're right or not,&quot; Tate interrupted,
with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If your theory is correct, the only thing
for Madame Le Baron to do is to go back
to her performance. Then she'll meet her
rival on her own ground. From what I've
read about that other performer, Madame
Le Baron's dive must be twice as difficult
and twice as thrilling as hers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate turned to her husband with
a look of admiration, her breath coming and
going in quick gasps. &quot;Percy, that's the
wisest thing you've ever said in your life.&quot;
A moment later she added, with a change
of tone: &quot;But isn't the whole thing <i>too</i>
absurd?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He started to go upstairs. &quot;You know
we're due at the Bigelows in an hour?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said Mrs. Tate. &quot;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
want to think over what you said. You
can't imagine how this thing has worried
me. It's all due to my meddling. Oh, I
know that; you needn't say anything to
me about it. But I'm determined to help
that poor woman if I can. Oh, if I had
only followed your advice, and let them
alone!&quot; she moaned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's no use worrying now. The mischief's
done. He would probably have got
tired of her anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If something isn't done to bring him
back to her,&quot; she went on without heeding
his remark, &quot;it will kill her. I'm sure of that.
If you could only see her. She looks like
a ghost, and her hands tremble so! I don't
believe she's slept a wink for weeks. I
don't see how she gets through her performances.
A clinging creature like her
just <i>lives</i> on affection. Before she was married
she always had her mother to take care
of her. To think that that man should treat
her so! Oh, it's a shame, it's a shame!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tate was standing at the door. &quot;If she's
going to kill herself over that fellow, she
might as well have gone on with her diving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
and killed herself that way. You ask her if
she doesn't want to go back to it,&quot; he
added, with the quizzical smile, &quot;and see if
she won't jump at the chance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you suppose that she can suspect
for an instant that her husband fell in love
with her performance?&quot; she said, her eyes
following her husband up the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She probably hasn't reasoned it out, but
I haven't a doubt she feels it intuitively,&quot;
he replied, continuing his ascent. &quot;You just
ask her if she doesn't want to make the
plunge again and see what she'll say,&quot; he
concluded, smiling down at her from the
floor above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span></p>

<h2>XX</h2>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate tried, by an almost impassioned
kindness, to atone for her
neglect of Blanche during her absence from
London. She sent her flowers from her
conservatory, she bought gifts for the little
Jeanne, she called at the apartment in Upper
Bedford Place nearly every morning. During
these visits she did not once meet
Jules; Blanche told her that he always went
away soon after breakfast, and seldom returned
before dinner. Sometimes he did
not accompany her to the Hippodrome, but
he never failed to appear there during the
evening. The management had offered to
reëngage Miss King as soon as her contract
expired, and the diver thought of postponing
her return to America; but they had
not as yet come to terms, as the girl wanted
a much larger salary than she had been
receiving.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
It was this information that reminded Mrs.
Tate to ask Blanche if she were sorry she
had given up her plunge and if she ever
wished to resume it. Though she had at
first been impressed by the solution of
Blanche's troubles suggested by her husband,
she had on sober second thought dismissed
it as ridiculously romantic; such
things might happen in novels, but they
never could occur in real life. Her belief
was shaken, however, when she saw the pale
face light up at her question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Blanche cried, &quot;I have thought
of it. Sometimes&mdash;sometimes I think it
would be better if I hadn't given it up.
Then&mdash;then that woman wouldn't have
come.&quot; Her eyes filled with tears, but she
controlled herself and, a moment later, she
went on:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I&mdash;I thought it was wrong for me
to risk my life, and it made me so unhappy
for Jeanne's sake. But sometimes I think I
might have stopped being afraid. Before
Jeanne was born I never had the least
thought of fear, even after father was
killed, because I knew that was because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
the trapeze was weak. Oh, I'm sure,&quot; she
went on piteously,&mdash;&quot;I'm <i>sure</i> I shouldn't
be afraid any more!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Dr. Broughton, you remember what
he said, don't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said that when I stopped making
the plunge I should be better,&quot; Blanche replied
simply. &quot;But I'm not better; I feel
worse,&mdash;oh, so much worse! I know I
should be better if I tried it again. And I
sha'n't be afraid any more,&quot; she repeated,&mdash;&quot;even
for Jeanne. It would be so much
better for us all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This speech made Mrs. Tate wonder if,
as her husband had suggested, Blanche had
divined that Jules had cared for her performance
rather than for herself, and fancied
she could win him back by resuming it. Her
interest increased when she learned that
Jules and Miss King had not spoken to each
other for two evenings. Miss King's maid,
who had at last come from Manchester, and
who knew a little Canadian French, had
told Madeleine about it. Jules had urged
Miss King to accept Marshall's terms, and
was vexed with her because she refused and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
threatened to go back to America. This
had made him even more disagreeable at
home than he had been before; for the past
few days he had not spoken one pleasant
word to them, and he had not even noticed
Jeanne.</p>

<p class="indent">It was this information that rang in Mrs.
Tate's consciousness when she had left the
apartment. Jules and that woman had quarrelled!
Of course, they would make it up
again,&mdash;perhaps in a few days, perhaps
that very day; but if they did not, the
quarrel might be one of the means of winning
him back to his wife. At any rate,
she would speak to her husband about it.
When, on her return home, she did speak,
he burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't see how you can find anything
funny in that!&quot; she said resentfully. &quot;It's
a very serious matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it threatens to spoil my beautiful
little romance!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your beautiful romance? What do you
mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you had persuaded her to go back to
her diving, and if she drove the other woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
out of the field in that way, it would be a
proof of my theory that he's fallen in love
with the <i>performance</i> and not with the <i>performer</i>.
But if his wife gets him back again
now, it will be merely because the other
woman has broken with him. There's nothing
for him to do <i>except</i> to go back to his
wife and be forgiven.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I don't care what the reason is&mdash;if
she only <i>gets</i> him back. She'll certainly die
of jealousy and misery if she doesn't,&mdash;that's
plain enough. In my opinion, Dr.
Broughton was entirely wrong in his diagnosis
of the case. She says herself that she
misses her diving and she wants to take it up
again. Her rest hasn't done her a particle
of good. Anyway, I'll speak to the Doctor
about it to-morrow. I'll write a note, and
ask him to come in for tea if he can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And hold another council of war,&quot; her
husband suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A council of <i>peace</i>,&quot; she retorted smartly.
&quot;Oh, I know what you're thinking of! But
I'm determined to undo the harm I've
done. There's no time to be lost. If I
can get that poor little woman to resume her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
plunge while the husband's still quarrelling
with the other performer, I feel sure everything
will come out all right. He'll be interested
in her again. Don't you remember
how he used to brag about her? I suppose
you don't, but he did; and I could tell that
he was as proud of her as if she were the
most wonderful creature in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't see what she wants him for,&quot;
Tate said carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you're not a woman, and you can't
understand how women feel about men. I
sometimes think the worse men are, the more
their wives adore them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tate smiled, but he made no reply; he
was much more interested in the case than
he would allow himself to appear to be.
Indeed, he was so interested that he left
his office the next day earlier than usual,
in order to take part in the conference. He
found his wife in earnest talk with the
Doctor. Before coming to the house, Dr.
Broughton, at Mrs. Tate's suggestion, had
made a call on Madame Le Baron, and he
expressed his alarm at having found her so
thin and weak.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
&quot;Do you remember what I said the night
we had our first talk about her?&quot; he asked,
glancing at Tate. &quot;I was afraid then that if
she gave up her work it might upset her,
though I didn't see how she could go on
with the diving and keep whatever health
she had. Now she's a great deal worse off
than she was when I last saw her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then they discussed the case in all its
aspects. The Doctor laughed when Mrs.
Tate declared she believed the poor woman's
happiness depended on her resuming her
plunge. &quot;Oh, it may seem absurd to you!&quot;
she cried, growing more earnest under ridicule;
&quot;but Percy believes it, though he may
pretend to you that he doesn't. He was the
one who first suggested it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I really think the diving wouldn't hurt
her health so much as her worrying about
her husband does,&quot; the Doctor admitted.
&quot;Besides, she believes she won't be afraid
of it any more. She says her rest from it
has taken all her fear away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you think the best thing for her to
do would be to resume the plunge?&quot; said
Mrs. Tate.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
For a moment the Doctor stroked his
chin. &quot;Under the circumstances I should
say it might,&quot; he replied slowly. &quot;At any
rate, it would be worth trying. Of course, if
that haunting fear returned she'd have to
stop it again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A look of triumph flashed from the face of
Mrs. Tate; and when she glanced at her
husband she saw that he was trying to dissemble
his interest in the decision. &quot;I shall
tell her that to-morrow!&quot; she cried. &quot;It'll
be the best news the poor thing has had
for a long time. She's crazy to begin that
plunge again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope you are ready to take the consequences
of your interference in this business,&quot;
said Tate, dryly.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span></p>

<h2>XXI</h2>

<p class="indent">The next morning, in a long and secret
talk, Mrs. Tate communicated the
Doctor's judgment to Blanche. She learned
that Jules was still sullen and depressed.
That, of course, was a sign that his quarrel
with the diver had not as yet been made up.
Blanche said that she would speak to him at
once about resuming the plunge; so far as
she knew, no one had as yet been engaged
to take Miss King's place, and perhaps Mr.
Marshall would make a new contract with
her on the old terms. Mrs. Tate hurried
away in a state of feverish excitement, dreading,
yet hoping, that she might meet Jules
on the stairs, in order to reveal the great
news. She would have liked to return to
the apartment that very afternoon, to learn
the effect of the announcement upon him;
but she controlled her impatience.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
Jules did not return till late in the afternoon.
From his manner Blanche saw at once
that he was in a surly mood. He flung his
coat and hat on a chair and threw himself on
the couch. For a long time she did not dare
to speak to him. She thought he was going
to sleep, but she suddenly saw him staring at
her with a look that frightened her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jules!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">He had closed his eyes again, and he
seemed not to hear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jules.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He opened his eyes, and once more she
met that look. &quot;What is it?&quot; he grunted.
Her plaintive manner vexed him; it seemed
like a reflection on himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's something I want to say to
you,&quot; she went on apologetically, and with
a suggestion of tearfulness in her voice, as if
she felt disappointed at his manner of receiving
her news.</p>

<p class="indent">As he did not reply, she said: &quot;It's
about&mdash;about my plunge. I have been
thinking that I'm&mdash;I'm so much better
now&mdash;I mean I'm not so nervous&mdash;perhaps
I can begin it again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
He sat up on the couch, a light coming
into his eyes. For a moment he was too
surprised to speak. Then he said: &quot;Well,
I'm glad you're coming to your senses!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Encouraged by the change in his manner,
she repeated what Dr. Broughton had said
to Mrs. Tate. At the mention of the names,
Jules' face darkened; since that night at the
Tates' he had felt a personal resentment
against the Doctor, almost as strong as his
hatred of the Englishwoman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that woman's been here again today,
has she?&quot; he said bitterly. After a
brief silence, he added more gently: &quot;If
you feel able to do the plunge again, the
sooner you begin the better. I know that
Marshall will be glad enough to renew the
old contract. It will just fit in with his
plans,&quot; he continued, with a grim thought
of the diver's discomfiture on being superseded
by Blanche. &quot;I'll speak to him this
very night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche tried to smile, but the effort ended
in a sigh. She had thought that Jules would
show more enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we can't have any more nonsense,&quot; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
said, glancing at her again,&mdash;this time, however,
without the bitterness she had before
observed in his face. &quot;If you allow yourself
to be afraid of the plunge again, it will simply
ruin you as an attraction. It'll make the
managers think you're unreliable, and they
won't engage you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of his apparent indifference, Jules
was secretly delighted at the thought of his
wife's resuming her great dive. For the past
few days he had never felt so keenly the
humiliation of his own position. A petulant
remark of Lottie King's the day of their
quarrel had kept ringing in his ears: &quot;What
do <i>you</i> amount to anyway?&quot; Now he
thought triumphantly of the restoration of
his own dignity. With Blanche as the star
attraction of the Hippodrome, earning a
large salary, and with a choice of offers
from all over the world, he would become
a personage again! But he must guard her
more carefully. He must in future keep her
out of the way of interfering foreigners like
Mrs. Tate, who would put a lot of nonsense
into her head!</p>

<p class="indent">That night, when Jules consulted Marshall,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
he learned what he had already surmised,
that the manager was much upset by Miss
King's refusal to extend her engagement on
any but exorbitant terms, and though it
would be completed in two weeks, he had
not as yet found a sufficiently strong attraction
to take her place; so he was not only
willing, but glad, to renew with Blanche the
contract she had at first made with him.
Jules felt the more elated on being told that
Miss King had not been nearly so good an
attraction as his wife while giving the sensational
plunge. He was in high spirits when
he entered Blanche's dressing-room and told
her the news. Blanche flushed with pleasure,
not merely at the news, but at his affectionate
manner as well; Madeleine, however, though
she said nothing, seemed depressed. She
had hoped that the poor child would never
make that horrible dive again.</p>

<p class="indent">After that night Blanche was so happy
that she seemed like another creature from
the thin, white-faced little woman of the past
few weeks. Her eyes were bright, her cheeks
flushed. Jules had been so different with her,
she said to Mrs. Tate, since she had told him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
she would go on with the plunge. The night
before he had taken her to the Hippodrome,
and after the performance they had gone
with Madeleine to a <i>café</i>; it reminded them
of the days of their courtship in Paris.</p>

<p class="indent">The two weeks that followed were the
happiest Blanche had known since those first
days after the birth of her child. Jules'
devotion extended not only to her, but to
little Jeanne and to Madeleine as well. For
several days the gloom that had wrapped the
city during most of the winter lifted; the
sun shone, and the feeling of spring was
in the air. In the afternoons Blanche took
walks with Jules in the park, and on Sunday
they went to mass together and then drove
out to Richmond and dined there. They
agreed to pretend that they were still in
their days of courtship, and Jules delighted
Blanche by repeating some of the foolish
speeches he had made to her in the first
weeks of their love.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, too, they made great plans for
the future. The negotiations with Hicks in
New York had been broken off, but Jules
had heard of an Australian manager who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
was in London looking for performers to
appear during the following winter in Melbourne.
How fine it would be if they
could go out there and give performances
in the chief Australian cities! Blanche, however,
showed so little enthusiasm for this
plan that Jules abandoned it for a time.
Besides, he himself liked better the plan
she suggested of returning to the <i>Cirque
Parisien</i>. They might make an engagement
there that would enable them to pass
the winter in Paris. How good it would
be to be back there again! Perhaps they
could secure the little apartment in the
<i>rue de Lisbonne</i>. Jules became so enthusiastic
that he wrote to the manager in Paris,
proposing terms. After a winter there they
might think of going to Australia, where
they would be much better paid than in
Paris.</p>

<p class="indent">The thought of returning to France added
to Blanche's happiness. Oh, to see her
mother and Jeanne and Louise again! How
good it would be! There had been times
during the past few weeks when she felt as if
she could not bear to be separated from them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
any longer. But in Paris they could come
to see her; perhaps Monsieur Berthier would
let her mother and the girls pass a few weeks
with her. Of course, she would be with
them in Boulogne for the summer. When
she spoke of this to Jules, however, he said
nothing. He had in mind other plans, a
possible engagement at one of the French
watering places; but he thought it best not
to refer to this at present. He realized the
importance of making as much money as
possible and as quickly as possible. There
was no knowing how long his wife's nerve
would last. If she only held out for a few
years longer, they could make a fortune in
Australia and America. Then they could
retire, and live comfortably in Paris for the
rest of their lives. He expected to earn a
great deal of money in America; but he had
reasons for not speaking of that country at
all for the present.</p>

<p class="indent">The two weeks during which Blanche was
enjoying her new happiness were an exciting
time for Mrs. Tate, who felt as if she were
responsible for the success of her <i>protégée's</i>
return to her former place in the Hippodrome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
Every day she repaired to Upper
Bedford Place and held long conferences
with Blanche. Everything promised well,
she thought. Jules showed no signs of
returning to the thraldom of Lottie King.
How providential, Mrs. Tate thought, the
quarrel between them had been! She did
not know that, even before his break with
her, Jules had begun to tire of the diver's
domineering manner and of her habit of
ridiculing him; moreover, he had at last
perceived that she was only playing with
him. This had helped to prejudice him
against her performance, and as the novelty
of the performance wore off, he saw that it
was far inferior in daring and skill to his
wife's magnificent plunge. This had never
lost its fascination for him, and now, as he
assisted Blanche in her daily exercises he
felt the old thrill at its brilliancy and his
own sense of importance in having a part
in it.</p>

<p class="indent">On the afternoon of the day when her
plunge was to be resumed, Blanche took a
long rest. She was awakened by the crowing
of Jeanne in the next room. She raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
her hands to her head; at the thought of the
ordeal of the evening, a sudden dizziness
came upon her. It was more than three
months since she had made the dive, and she
wondered if she should be equal to it. How
horrible if at the last moment she should lose
her nerve! She arose quickly, hardly daring
to allow herself to think, and she hurried to
the child. How strong and beautiful Jeanne
was! Blanche took her in her arms and
pressed her closely. When Madeleine turned
and lumbered out of the room, leaving them
alone together, Blanche began to kiss the
child passionately, and tears welled over on
her cheeks. Then she bathed her face, for
fear that Jules would see that she had been
crying.</p>

<p class="indent">That night at dinner, Jules was in high
spirits. &quot;Marshall expects a big house,&quot;
he said. &quot;He's spent a lot of money
advertising your dive. He thinks of getting
a big poster made of you flying through
the air.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">During the whole of the meal Blanche
was very quiet. Madeleine noticed that her
eyes were shining. When it was time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
go to the Hippodrome, Jules, wrapping his
wife in her cloak, put his arms around
her, and kissed her on the ear, as he had
often done in the days of their engagement.
She drew away and started for Jeanne's
room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where are you going?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to kiss the little one good-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she's asleep!&quot; he cried impatiently.
&quot;You mustn't wake her up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In spite of his protest, she silently made
her way into the room where the child
lay, closing the door behind her. Jules
listened, thinking that Jeanne would cry on
being disturbed; but there was no sound.
Then he knew that she was praying by the
crib, and this angered him. It was about
time to put a stop to her notions, he said to
himself. When, a moment later, she came
out, her face was covered with a thick veil,
and, after glancing at her sharply, he said
nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">On arriving at the Hippodrome, they
found Mrs. Tate in the star dressing-room,
which had been assigned to Blanche again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been waiting for you,&quot; Mrs. Tate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
said nervously. &quot;I suppose I have no right
to be here, but I felt that I <i>must</i> see you,
and I made my husband bring me. Are
you quite well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had observed the look of disgust
given her by Jules, but this did not disturb
her nearly so much as the white face that
Blanche presented. Moreover, she did not
feel reassured when Blanche smiled and said
she felt perfectly well.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course everything will be splendid.
There's a tremendous crowd,&quot; Mrs. Tate
added. &quot;You'll have a great success.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jules, after bowing coldly, had turned from
the room. As soon as the door closed behind
him, Mrs. Tate seized Blanche by both
hands and kissed her affectionately. &quot;I
mustn't keep you from dressing,&quot; she said
with a smile. &quot;Perhaps I'll come in and
congratulate you when it's all over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche grew a shade paler, and Mrs.
Tate hesitated at the door. &quot;What is it?&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate walked toward her. &quot;Nothing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blanche turned her head away. &quot;If anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span>
should happen,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;the&mdash;the
little one&mdash;I should like my mother
to take her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Tate began to breathe hard; but
she burst out laughing. &quot;You silly child!
Of course; I shall look after Jeanne anyway.
Don't you worry about <i>her</i>. Now I
must hurry out to that husband of mine.
He'll be furious with me for keeping him
waiting so long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A few moments before Blanche appeared
in the ring, Jules returned to the dressing-room,
resplendent in his evening clothes,
with three diamonds gleaming on his shirt-front,
and carrying a bouquet of white roses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These are just like the roses I bought
for you the night I met you. I selected
them this afternoon, and they've just come.
You must wear them in your belt, as you
did then,&quot; he said, as she flushed with pleasure
and thanked him. &quot;I remember how
tickled I was when I saw them; and oh,
how I hated Pelletier when you took them
out and gave them to him to hold, while you
were going through your act.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, as she adjusted the flowers in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
belt, he went on: &quot;It's the biggest house
of the season! Marshall says you're the best
attraction he ever had. Ready?&quot; he asked,
surveying Blanche as she stood in her white
silk tights. &quot;You look just as you did when
I first saw you,&quot; he added, putting one hand
on her cheek and kissing her lightly on the
other. &quot;Come along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he threw over her the robe she
always wore on her way to the ring, and they
hurried from the room. As Blanche ran out
on the net and heard the applause of the vast
audience, she felt a thrill of joy and an intoxicating
sense of her own power. All fear
seemed to leave her, and she laughed as
she climbed hand over hand to the trapeze.
From trapeze to trapeze she shot with delight;
she had never felt so sure of herself,
so exultant. When she returned to the net,
Jules, who had taken his place at the rope,
whispered to her: &quot;You're in great form
to-night. Keep it up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was smiling as she started on her long
climb to the top of the building. But when
she had taken her place on the beam from
which she was to make her plunge and looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
down at the black mass in the distance, her
strength seemed suddenly to leave her. Her
fingers tightened on the beam, as if she felt
afraid of losing her balance. Then she heard
her husband's voice ring through the place,
crying the familiar warning. She knew the
moment had come for making the plunge;
but she continued motionless. She felt as if
her will had become suddenly paralyzed, and
a moment later, as if her body were frozen.</p>

<p class="indent">The black mass below seemed to dance
before her, then to beckon to her, and in her
ears she kept hearing the voice of little Jeanne
and the sound of her laughter. Oh, she had
known that this moment would come some
time; she had known it ever since Jeanne was
born. But she could not sit there forever;
the crowd below was waiting to see her fall.
If she did not make an effort she should lose
her self-control and go plunging into the
blackness. She must lift her hands and
gather herself together, and hurl herself out
as she had always done. But she had no
strength; she could only lift her arms weakly.
Then she tried to give her body the necessary
impetus, and she plunged wildly into the air.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
There was a cry of horror from the crowd,
and a moment later the white figure lay
motionless in the net. The people rose
from their seats and rushed toward the ring.
The police tried to drive them back as Jules
leaped into the net and seized the prostrate
body in his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep them back,&quot; he cried frantically,
not realizing that he was speaking French.
&quot;She must have air.&quot; Then, turning, he
said: &quot;Blanche! Blanche! Can't you
speak? Open your eyes so I may know
you aren't dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was terrified by the way her head fell
back from her shoulders. &quot;We must get
her out of this,&quot; he said desperately, to two
of the circus men who had followed him on
the net, as he glanced down at the struggling
mass beneath him. &quot;Bring her to her
dressing-room. Make those people get out
of the way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With difficulty they bore her through the
crowd. Some one threw her cloak over her
as she passed. She gave no sign of life, but
the expression in Jules' face showed that he
still hoped. When they reached her room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
they placed her on the floor, and Jules
closed the door to keep out the crowd.
Madeleine, who had been ringing her hands
and moaning, quickly loosened the tight bodice.
Then the door was forced open again,
and Marshall entered with a physician, who
quickly bent over the prostrate figure and
listened for the heart-beat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's dead,&quot; he said quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">Jules threw himself on the body in a
paroxysm of despair.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
